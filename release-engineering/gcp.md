## IAM

The following kubernetes.io Google Groups exist to grant Release Managers access to K8s Infra GCP resources.

Mail to the groups below will be ignored. Please instead use the [contact groups listed on the Release Managers page][release-managers].

- `k8s-infra-release-admins` - Release Engineering subproject owners
- `k8s-infra-release-editors` - Patch Release Team / Branch Managers
- `k8s-infra-release-viewers` - Release Manager Associates

[Membership](https://git.k8s.io/k8s.io/groups/groups.yaml) and [permissions](https://git.k8s.io/k8s.io/infra/gcp/ensure-release-projects.sh) for each group is defined in [kubernetes/k8s.io](https://git.k8s.io/k8s.io).

| `k8s-staging-releng-test` | Active | Kubernetes | Release Engineering | Staging project for Release Engineering build images (K8s Infra) |

## KMS

Release Engineering GCP projects often require access to sensitive credentials to execute work.

An example is the `k8s-release-robot`'s GitHub token, used to commit, push, and create GitHub releases for `kubernetes/kubernetes`.

To facilitate this on K8s Infra, we use the `k8s-releng-prod` project to store KMS assets.

Decryption access to specific keyrings within the `k8s-releng-prod` project is then delegated out to the other Release Engineering GCP projects by members of the `k8s-infra-release-admins` group.

To date, the following projects have access to decrypt KMS assets:

- `k8s-staging-kubernetes`
- `k8s-staging-releng`
