## Handbooks

**NOTE: The Patch Release Team and Branch Manager handbooks will be deduplicated at a later date.**

- [Patch Release Team](/release-engineering/role-handbooks/patch-release-team.md)
- [Branch Managers](/release-engineering/role-handbooks/branch-manager.md)
- [Build Admins](/release-engineering/packaging.md)

## Release Managers

Release Managers are responsible for:

- Coordinating patch releases (`x.y.z`, where `z` > 0) of Kubernetes
- Minor releases (`x.y.z`, where `z` = 0) of Kubernetes, working with the
  [Release Team](/release-team/README.md) through each release cycle
- Mentoring the [Release Manager Associates](#associates) group
- Actively developing features and maintaining the code in k/release
- Supporting Associates as they collaborate with and help the Release Team during
the release cycle

This team at times works in close conjunction with the
[Product Security Committee][psc] and therefore should abide by the guidelines
set forth in the [Security Release Process][security-release-process].

## Associates

Release Manager Associates are apprentices to the Branch Managers, formerly
referred to as Branch Manager shadows. They are responsible for:

- Patch release work, cherry pick review
- Contributing to k/release: updating dependencies and getting used to the source codebase
- Working on minor releases (x.y.z, where z = 0) 
- With help from a release manager, working with the Release Team during the release cycle
- Seek opportunities to help with prioritization and communication
    - Send out pre-announcements and updates about patch releases

## Build Admins

Build Admins are (currently) Google employees with the requisite access to
Google build systems/tooling to publish deb/rpm packages on behalf of the
Kubernetes project. They are responsible for:

- Building, signing, and publishing the deb/rpm packages
- Being the interlock with Release Managers (and Associates) on the final steps 
of each minor (1.Y) and patch (1.Y.Z) release

## SIG Release Leads

SIG Release Chairs and Technical Leads are responsible for:

- The governance of SIG Release
- Leading knowledge exchange sessions for Release Managers and Associates
- Coaching on leadership and prioritization

They are mentioned explicitly here as they are owners of the
various communications channels and permissions groups (GitHub teams,
GCP access) for each role. As such, they are highly privileged community members and 
privy to some private communications, which can at times relate to Kubernetes security 
disclosures.
