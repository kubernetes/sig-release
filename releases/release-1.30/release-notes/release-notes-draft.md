## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Kubectl: remove deprecated flag prune-whitelist for apply, use flag prune-allowlist instead. ([#120246](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120246), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Removed the `SecurityContextDeny` admission plugin, deprecated since v1.27. The Pod Security Admission plugin, available since v1.25, is recommended instead. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#securitycontextdeny for more information. ([#122612](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122612), [@mtardy](https://github.com/mtardy)) [SIG Auth, Security and Testing]

### API Change

- Add CEL library for IP Addresses and CIDRs. This will not be available for use until 1.31. ([#121912](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121912), [@JoelSpeed](https://github.com/JoelSpeed)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added a CBOR implementation of `runtime.Serializer`. Until CBOR graduates to Alpha, API servers will refuse to start if configured with CBOR support. ([#122881](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122881), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added audienceMatchPolicy field to AuthenticationConfiguration and support for configuring multiple audiences.
  
  - The "audienceMatchPolicy" can be empty (or unset) when a single audience is specified in the "audiences" field.
  - The "audienceMatchPolicy" must be set to "MatchAny" when multiple audiences are specified in the "audiences" field. ([#123165](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123165), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Added to MutableFeatureGate the ability to override the default setting of feature gates, to allow default-enabling a feature on a component-by-component basis instead of for all affected components simultaneously. ([#122647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122647), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery and Cluster Lifecycle]
- Adds a rule on the kube_codegen tool to ignore vendor folder during the code generation. ([#122729](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122729), [@jparrill](https://github.com/jparrill)) [SIG API Machinery and Cluster Lifecycle]
- Allow users to mutate FSGroupPolicy and PodInfoOnMount in CSIDriver.Spec ([#116209](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116209), [@haoruan](https://github.com/haoruan)) [SIG API Machinery, Storage and Testing]
- Client-go events: `NewEventBroadcasterAdapterWithContext` should be used instead of `NewEventBroadcasterAdapter` if the goal is to support contextual logging. ([#122142](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122142), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Contextual logging is now beta and enabled by default. ([#122589](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122589), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Instrumentation]
- Cri-api: KEP-3857: Recursive Read-only (RRO) mounts ([#123272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123272), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda)) [SIG Node]
- Enabled a mechanism for concurrent log rotatation via `kubelet` using a configuration entity of `containerLogMaxWorkers` which controls the maximum number of concurrent rotation that can be performed and an interval configuration of `containerLogMonitorInterval` that can aid is configuring the monitoring duration to best suite your cluster's log generation standards. ([#114301](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114301), [@harshanarayana](https://github.com/harshanarayana)) [SIG API Machinery, Node and Testing]
- Fixes accidental enablement of the new alpha `optionalOldSelf` API field in CustomResourceDefinition validation rules, which should only be allowed to be set when the CRDValidationRatcheting feature gate is enabled. ([#122329](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122329), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Implement  `prescore` extension point for `volumeBinding` plugin. Return skip if it doesn't do anything in Score. ([#115768](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115768), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kubelet: a custom root directory for pod logs (instead of default /var/log/pods) can be specified using the `podLogsDir`
  key in kubelet configuration. ([#112957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112957), [@mxpv](https://github.com/mxpv)) [SIG API Machinery, Node, Scalability and Testing]
- PodSpec API: remove note that hostAliases are not supported on hostNetwork Pods. The feature has been supported since v1.8. ([#122422](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122422), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Resource.k8s.io/ResourceClaim (alpha API): the strategic merge patch strategy for the `status.reservedFor` array was changed such that a strategic-merge-patch can add individual entries. This breaks clients using strategic merge patch to update status which rely on the previous behavior (replacing the entire array). ([#122276](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122276), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Text logging in Kubernetes components now uses [textlogger](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/klog/v2@v2.120.0/textlogger). The same split streams of info and error log entries with buffering of info entries is now also supported for text output (off by default, alpha feature). Previously, this was only supported for JSON. Performance is better also without split streams. ([#114672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114672), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Storage and Testing]
- This change adds the following CLI option for `kube-controller-manager`:
  - `disable-force-detach` (defaults to `false`): Prevent force detaching volumes based on maximum unmount time and node status. If enabled, the non-graceful node shutdown feature must be used to recover from node failure (see https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/16/kubernetes-1-28-non-graceful-node-shutdown-ga/). If enabled and a pod must be forcibly terminated at the risk of corruption, then the appropriate VolumeAttachment object (see here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/volume-attachment-v1/) must be deleted. ([#120344](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120344), [@rohitssingh](https://github.com/rohitssingh)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Storage and Testing]
- Updated an audit annotation key used by the `…/serviceaccounts/<name>/token` resource handler.
  The annotation used to persist the issued credential identifier is now `authentication.kubernetes.io/issued-credential-id`. ([#123098](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123098), [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz)) [SIG Auth]
- When scheduling a mixture of pods using ResourceClaims and others which don't, scheduling a pod with ResourceClaims impacts scheduling latency less. ([#121876](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121876), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Node, Scheduling and Testing]

### Feature

- A new kubelet metric image_pull_duration_seconds is added. The metric tracks the duration (in seconds) it takes for an image to be pulled, including the time spent in the waiting queue of image puller. The metric is broken down by bucketed image size. ([#121719](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121719), [@ruiwen-zhao](https://github.com/ruiwen-zhao)) [SIG Instrumentation and Node]
- A new metric `lifecycle_handler_sleep_terminated_total` is added to record how many times LifecycleHandler sleep got unexpectedly terminated. ([#122456](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122456), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Add "reason" field to image_garbage_collected_total metric, so admins can differentiate images that were collected for reason "age" vs "space" ([#123345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123345), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander)) [SIG Node]

- Add process_start_time_seconds to /metrics/slis endpoint of all components ([#122750](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122750), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG Architecture, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Added a new metric `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reloads_total` to measure total number of
  API server encryption configuration reload successes and failures.
  This metric contains the `status` label with a value that is either `success` or `failure`.
  
  Deprecated the metrics `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reload_success_total`
  and `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reload_failure_total`.
  Use `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reloads_total` instead. ([#123179](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123179), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Added support for cloud provider integrations to supply optional, per-Node custom labels that will be
  applied to Nodes by the node controller.
  Extra labels will only be applied where the cloud provider integration implements this. ([#123223](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123223), [@mmerkes](https://github.com/mmerkes)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Adds exec-interactive-mode and exec-provide-cluster-info flags in kubectl config set-credentials command ([#122023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122023), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI]
- Allow a zero value for the 'nominalConcurrencyShares' field of the PriorityLevelConfiguration object 
  either using the flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 or flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 API ([#123001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123001), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Allow scheduling framework plugins that implement io.Closer to be gracefully closed. ([#122498](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122498), [@Gekko0114](https://github.com/Gekko0114)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Change --nodeport-addresses behavior to default to "primary node IP(s) only" rather than "all node IPs". ([#122724](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122724), [@nayihz](https://github.com/nayihz)) [SIG Network and Windows]
- Embed Node information into Pod-bound service account tokens as additional metadata
  - Set the 'JTI' field in issued service account tokens, and embed this information as `authentication.kubernetes.io/credential-id` in user's ExtraInfo ([#123135](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123135), [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Etcd: build image for v3.5.11 ([#122233](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122233), [@mzaian](https://github.com/mzaian)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Feature gates for RemoteCommand (kubectl exec, cp, and attach) over WebSockets are now enabled by default (Beta).
  - Server-side feature gate: TranslateStreamCloseWebsocketRequests
  - Client-side (kubectl) feature gate: KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS
  - To turn off RemoteCommand over WebSockets for kubectl, the environment variable feature gate must be explicitly set - KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS=false ([#123281](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123281), [@seans3](https://github.com/seans3)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI and Testing]
- Graduate "Forensic Container Checkpointing" (KEP #2008) from Alpha to Beta. ([#123215](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123215), [@adrianreber](https://github.com/adrianreber)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Graduated support for passing dual-stack `kubelet --node-ip` values when using
  a cloud provider. The feature is now GA and the `CloudDualStackNodeIPs` feature
  gate is always enabled. ([#123134](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123134), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Node]
- Informers now support adding Indexers after the informer starts ([#117046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117046), [@howardjohn](https://github.com/howardjohn)) [SIG API Machinery]
- InitContainer's image location will be considered in scheduling when prioritizing nodes. ([#123366](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123366), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Introduce a feature gate mechanism to client-go. Depending on the actual implementation, users can control features via environmental variables or command line options. ([#122555](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122555), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kube-apiserver now reloads the `--authorization-config` file when it changes. Reloads increment the `apiserver_authorization_config_controller_automatic_reload_last_timestamp_seconds` timestamp metric, with `status="success"` for successful reloads and `status="failed"` for failed reloads. Failed reloads keep using the previously loaded authorization configuration. ([#121946](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121946), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver now reports metrics for authorization decisions in the `apiserver_authorization_decisions_total` metric, labeled by authorizer type, name, and decision. ([#123333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123333), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-controller-manager: increase the global level for broadcaster's logging to 3 so that users can ignore event messages by lowering the logging level. It reduces information noise. ([#122293](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122293), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Autoscaling, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the NodeAffinity plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to only retry scheduling a Pod
  that was previously rejected by the NodeAffinity plugin if a new Node or a Node update matches the Pod's node affinity. ([#122309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122309), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the NodeResourceFit plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to only retry scheduling a Pod
  that was previously rejected by the NodeResourceFit plugin if a new Node or 
  a Node update matches the Pod's resource requirements or if an old pod update 
  or delete matches the  Pod's resource requirements. ([#119177](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119177), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the NodeUnschedulable plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to only retry scheduling a Pod
  that was previously rejected by the NodeSchedulable plugin if a new Node or a Node update sets .spec.unschedulable to false. ([#122334](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122334), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the PodTopologySpread plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to retry scheduling a Pod
  that was previously rejected by the PodTopologySpread plugin if create/delete/update a related Pod or a node which matches the toplogyKey. ([#122195](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122195), [@nayihz](https://github.com/nayihz)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kubeadm: add better handling of errors during unmount when calling "kubeadm reset". When failing to unmount directories under "/var/run/kubelet", kubeadm will now throw an error instead of showing a warning and continuing to cleanup said directory. In such situations it is better for you to inspect the problem and resolve it manually, then you can call "kubeadm reset" again to complete the cleanup. ([#122530](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122530), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: add support for machine readable output with "-o yaml" and "-o json" to the command "kubeadm certs check-expiration". This change is added in a new API "kind": "CertificateExpirationInfo",  "apiVersion": "output.kubeadm.k8s.io/v1alpha3". The existing non structured formatting is preserved. The output API version v1alpha2 is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate to using v1alpha3. ([#123372](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123372), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: add the WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents feature gate. It can be used to tell kubeadm to wait for all control plane components to be ready when running "kubeadm init" or "kubeadm join --control-plane". Currently kubeadm only waits for the kube-apiserver. The "kubeadm join" workflow now includes a new experimental phase called "wait-control-plane". This phase will be marked as non-experimental when WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents becomes GA. Accordingly a "kubeadm init" phase "wait-control-plane" will also be available once WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents becomes GA. These phases can be skipped if the user prefers to not wait for the control plane components. ([#123341](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123341), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubectl debug: add sysadmin profile ([#119200](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119200), [@eiffel-fl](https://github.com/eiffel-fl)) [SIG CLI and Testing]

- Kubernetes is now built with go 1.22 ([#123217](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123217), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built with go 1.22rc2 ([#122889](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122889), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- LoadBalancerIPMode feature is now marked as Beta ([#123418](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123418), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- New alpha feature gate `SELinuxMount` can be used to speed up SELinux relabeling of volumes. ([#123157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123157), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG Node and Storage]
- NewVolumeManagerReconstruction feature is now GA. ([#123442](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123442), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG Node]
- Print more information when kubectl describe a VolumeAttributesClass ([#122640](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122640), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG CLI]
- Promote KubeProxyDrainingTerminatingNodes to Beta ([#122914](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122914), [@alexanderConstantinescu](https://github.com/alexanderConstantinescu)) [SIG Network]
- Promote feature gate StableLoadBalancerNodeSet to GA ([#122961](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122961), [@alexanderConstantinescu](https://github.com/alexanderConstantinescu)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Network]
- Promoted the `CRDValidationRatcheting` feature gate to beta, and made it enabled by default. ([#121461](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121461), [@alexzielenski](https://github.com/alexzielenski)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Scheduler skips NodeAffinity Score plugin when NodeAffinity Score plugin has nothing to do with a Pod.
  You might notice an increase in the metric plugin_execution_duration_seconds for extension_point=score plugin=NodeAffinity, because the plugin will only run when the plugin is relevant ([#117024](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117024), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- The Kubelet rejects creating the pod if hostUserns=false and the CRI runtime does not support user namespaces. ([#123216](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123216), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe)) [SIG Node]
- The option `ignorable` of scheduler extender can skip error both filter and bind. ([#122503](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122503), [@sunbinnnnn](https://github.com/sunbinnnnn)) [SIG Scheduling]
- The scheduler retries Pods, which are failed by nodevolumelimits due to not found PVCs, only when new PVCs are added. ([#121952](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121952), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Update ImageGCMaxAge behavior in the kubelet to wait the MaxAge duration after the kubelet has restarted before garbage collecting ([#123343](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123343), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Update distroless-iptables to v0.5.0 debian-base to bookworm-v1.0.1 and setcap to bookworm-v1.0.1 ([#123170](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123170), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Cloud Provider, Release, Storage and Testing]
- Update kubedns and nodelocaldns to release version 1.22.28 ([#121908](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121908), [@mzaian](https://github.com/mzaian)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Update some interfaces' signature in scheduler:
  
  1. PluginsRunner: use NodeInfo in `RunPreScorePlugins` and `RunScorePlugins`.
  2. PreScorePlugin: use NodeInfo in `PreScore`.
  3. Extender: use NodeInfo in `Filter` and `Prioritize`. ([#121954](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121954), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Autoscaling, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Users can traverse all the pods that are in the scheduler and waiting in the permit stage through method `IterateOverWaitingPods`. In other words,  all waitingPods in scheduler can be obtained from any profiles. Before this commit, each profile could only obtain waitingPods within that profile. ([#122946](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122946), [@NoicFank](https://github.com/NoicFank)) [SIG Scheduling]
- ValidatingAdmissionPolicy now supports type checking policies that make use of `variables`. ([#123083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123083), [@jiahuif](https://github.com/jiahuif)) [SIG API Machinery]
- When PreFilterResult filters out some Nodes, the scheduling framework assumes them as rejected via `UnschedulableAndUnresolvable`, 
  that is those nodes won't be in the candidates of preemption process.
  Also, corrected how the scheduling framework handle Unschedulable status from PreFilter. 
  Before this PR, if PreFilter return `Unschedulable`, it may result in an unexpected abortion in the preemption, 
  which shouldn't happen in the default scheduler, but may happen in schedulers with a custom plugin. ([#119779](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119779), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- When the RetryGenerateName feature gate is enabled on the kube-apiserver,
  create requests using generateName are retried automatically by the apiserver when the generated name conflicts with an existing resource name, up to a max limit of 7 retries.
  This feature is in alpha. ([#122887](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122887), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery]
- `kubectl describe`: added Suspend to job, and Node-Selectors and Tolerations to pod template output ([#122618](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122618), [@ivanvc](https://github.com/ivanvc)) [SIG CLI]

### Documentation

- A deprecated flag `--pod-max-in-unschedulable-pods-duration` was initially planned to be removed in v1.26, but we have to change this plan. We found [an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175) in which Pods can be stuck in the unschedulable pod pool for 5 min, and using this flag is the only workaround for this issue. 
  This issue only could happen if you use custom plugins or if you change plugin set being used in your scheduler via the scheduler config. ([#122013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122013), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]

- The initialization of nodes using external cloud-providers now waits for the providerID value to be available before declaring the node ready. This is required because previously, if there were errors of communication with the cloud-provider on the cloud-controller-manager, nodes may have been declared Ready without having this field or the zone labels, and the information was never reconciled. The providerID and the zone labels are required for integrations like loadbalancers to work correctly. Users still can opt-out to this new behavior by setting the feature flag OptionalProviderID in the cloud-controller-manager.
