  text: "Users can now traverse all the pods that are in the scheduler and waiting
    in the permit stage through method `IterateOverWaitingPods`. In other words,  all
    waitingPods in scheduler can be obtained from any profiles. Before this commit,
    each profile could only obtain `waitingPods` within that profile"
