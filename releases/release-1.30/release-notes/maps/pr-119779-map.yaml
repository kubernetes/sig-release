  text: When a PreFilterResult filters out certain Nodes, the scheduling framework
    now categorizes them as rejected via `UnschedulableAndUnresolvable`. Consequently,
    these nodes are excluded from the candidates for the preemption process. Additionally,
    this update corrects how the scheduling framework handles the Unschedulable status
    from PreFilter. Previously, if PreFilter returned `Unschedulable`, it could lead
    to an unexpected abortion in the preemption process, which shouldn't occur in
    the default scheduler but might occur in schedulers with custom plugins.
