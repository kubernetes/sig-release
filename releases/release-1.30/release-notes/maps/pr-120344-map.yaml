    Added the following CLI option for `kube-controller-manager`:
    - `disable-force-detach` (defaults to `false`): Prevent force detaching volumes based on maximum unmount time and node status. If enabled, the non-graceful node shutdown feature must be used to recover from node failure (see https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/16/kubernetes-1-28-non-graceful-node-shutdown-ga/). If enabled and a pod must be forcibly terminated at the risk of corruption, then the appropriate VolumeAttachment object (see here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/volume-attachment-v1/) must be deleted.
