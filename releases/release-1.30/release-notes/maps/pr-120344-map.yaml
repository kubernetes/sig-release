  text: Added the `disable-force-detach` CLI option for `kube-controller-manager`.
    By default, it's set to `false`. When enabled, it prevents force detaching volumes
    based on maximum unmount time and node status. If activated, the non-graceful
    node shutdown feature must be used to recover from node failure. Additionally,
    if a pod needs to be forcibly terminated at the risk of corruption, the appropriate
    VolumeAttachment object must be deleted.
