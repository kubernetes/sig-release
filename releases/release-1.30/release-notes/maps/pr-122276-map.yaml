    "resource.k8s.io/ResourceClaim (alpha API): The strategic merge patch strategy for the `status.reservedFor` array was changed so that a strategic-merge-patch can now add individual entries. This change may break clients using strategic merge patch to update status, which rely on the previous behavior (replacing the entire array)."
