    "Added (alpha) support for the `managedBy` field on Jobs. Jobs with a custom value of this field - any value other than `kubernetes.io/job-controller` - were skipped by the job controller, and their reconciliation was delegated to an external controller, indicated by the value of the field. Jobs that didn't have this field at all, or where the field value was the reserved string `kubernetes.io/job-controller`, were reconciled by the built-in job controller."
