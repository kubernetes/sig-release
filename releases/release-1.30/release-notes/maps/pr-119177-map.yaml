  text: "kube-scheduler implemented scheduling hints for the `NodeResourceFit` plugin.
    The scheduling hints allowed the scheduler to only retry scheduling a Pod that had 
    been previously rejected by the `NodeResourceFit` plugin if a new Node or a Node update 
    matched the Pod's resource requirements or if an old pod update or delete matched the Pod's resource requirements."
