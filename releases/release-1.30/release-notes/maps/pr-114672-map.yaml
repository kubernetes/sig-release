releasenote:
  text: Text logging in Kubernetes components now uses [textlogger](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/klog/v2@v2.120.0/textlogger).
    The same split streams of info and error log entries with buffering of info entries
    is now also supported for text output (off by default, alpha feature). Previously,
    this was only supported for JSON. Performance is better also without split streams.
