  text: 'kubeadm: added support for machine readable output with "-o yaml" and "-o
    json" to the command "kubeadm certs check-expiration". This change is added in
    a new API "kind": "CertificateExpirationInfo",  "apiVersion": "output.kubeadm.k8s.io/v1alpha3".
    The existing non structured formatting is preserved. The output API version v1alpha2
    is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate to using
    v1alpha3.'
