  text: "A deprecated flag `--pod-max-in-unschedulable-pods-duration` was initially
    planned to be removed in v1.26, but we had to change this plan. We found [an
    issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175) in which Pods can
    be stuck in the unschedulable pod pool for 5 min, and using this flag is the only
    workaround for this issue. \nThis issue only could happen if you use custom plugins
    or if you change plugin set being used in your scheduler via the scheduler config."
