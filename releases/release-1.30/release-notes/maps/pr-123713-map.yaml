  text: The initialization of nodes using external cloud providers now waits for the
    providerID value to be available before untainting it. This ensures that nodes
    are not declared Ready without necessary information such as the providerID and
    zone labels, which are required for integrations like load balancers to function
    correctly. Cloud providers that do not implement the GetInstanceProviderID method
    will not require the providerID to be set and will not fail to initialize the
    node for backward compatibility.
