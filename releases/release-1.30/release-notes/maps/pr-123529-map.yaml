  text: The kubernetes repo now uses Go workspaces.  This should not impact end users
    at all, but does have impact for developers of downstream projects.  Switching
    to workspaces caused some breaking changes in the flags to the various k8s.io/code-generator
    tools.  Downstream consumers should look at staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/kube_codegen.sh
    to see the changes.
