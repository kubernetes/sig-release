  text: Enabled a mechanism for concurrent log rotatation via `kubelet` using a configuration
    entity of `containerLogMaxWorkers` which controls the maximum number of concurrent
    rotation that can be performed and an interval configuration of `containerLogMonitorInterval`
    that can aid in configuring the monitoring duration to best suite your cluster's
    log generation standards.
