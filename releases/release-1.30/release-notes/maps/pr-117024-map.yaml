  text: "Scheduler skips NodeAffinity Score plugin when NodeAffinity Score plugin
    has nothing to do \nwith a Pod. You might notice an increase in the metric `plugin_execution_duration_seconds`
    for `extension_point=score` `plugin=NodeAffinity`, because the plugin will only
    run when the plugin is relevant."
