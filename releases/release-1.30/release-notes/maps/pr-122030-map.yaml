  text: "For statically provisioned PVs, if its volume source is CSI type or it has
    #     migrated annotation, when it's deleted, the PersisentVolume controller won't
    change #     its phase to the Failed state. \n\nWith this patch, the external
    provisioner can #     remove the finalizer in next reconcile loop. Unfortunately
    if the provious existing #     pv has the Failed state, this patch won't take
    effort. It requires users to remove #     finalizer."
