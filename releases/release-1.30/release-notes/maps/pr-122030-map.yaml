  text: For statically provisioned PVs, if its volume source is CSI type or it has
    migrated annotation, when it's deleted, the PersisentVolume controller won't change
    its phase to the Failed state. With this patch, the external provisioner can remove
    the finalizer in the next reconcile loop. Unfortunately, if the previous existing pv
    has the Failed state, this patch won't take effort. It requires users to remove
    finalizer.
