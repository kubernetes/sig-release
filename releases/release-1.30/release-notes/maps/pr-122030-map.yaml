  text: For statically provisioned PVs, if their volume source is of CSI type or they
    have a migrated annotation, when they are deleted, the PersistentVolume controller
    won't change their phase to the Failed state. With this patch, the external provisioner
    can remove the finalizer in the next reconcile loop. Unfortunately, if a previously
    existing PV has the Failed state, this patch won't take effect. Users are required
    to remove the finalizer manually.
