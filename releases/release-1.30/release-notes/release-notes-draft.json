    "markdown": "Kubeadm: added the WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents feature gate. It can be used to tell kubeadm to wait for all control plane components to be ready when running \"kubeadm init\" or \"kubeadm join --control-plane\". Currently kubeadm only waits for the kube-apiserver. The \"kubeadm join\" workflow now includes a new experimental phase called \"wait-control-plane\".

Accordingly a \"kubeadm init\" phase \"wait-control-plane\" will also be available once WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents becomes GA.
