## Action Required

- Move volume dynamic provisioning scheduling to beta (The DynamicProvisioningScheduling alpha feature gate has been removed. The VolumeScheduling beta feature gate is still required for this feature) ([#67432](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67432), [@lichuqiang](https://github.com/lichuqiang))
- the API server and client-go libraries have been fixed to support additional non-alpha-numeric characters in UserInfo "extra" data keys. Both should be updated in order to properly support extra data containing "/" characters or other characters disallowed in HTTP headers. ([#65799](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65799), [@dekkagaijin](https://github.com/dekkagaijin))

If using `--admission-control` to fully specify the set of admission plugins, the `Priority` admission plugin should be added if using the `PodPriority` feature, which is enabled by default in 1.11. ([#65739](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65739), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

If a dry-run request is made on a resource that triggers a non dry-run supporting webhook, the request will be completely rejected, with "400: Bad Request". Additionally, a new field is being added to the admission.k8s.io/v1beta1.AdmissionReview API object, exposing to webhooks whether or not the request being reviewed is a dry-run.

([#65147](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65147), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

Now, the following behavior occurs: ([#67041](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67041), [@tristanburgess](https://github.com/tristanburgess))
- kube-controller-manager can now start the quota controller when discovery results can only be partially determined. ([#67433](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67433), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))

- Remove unused binary and container image for kube-aggregator. The functionality is already integrated into the kube-apiserver. ([#67157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67157), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))

Examples of CONNECT APIs are the `nodes/proxy`, `services/proxy`, `pods/proxy`, `pods/exec`, and `pods/attach` subresources. Note that this prevents sending a `dryRun` parameter to backends via `{nodes,services,pods}/proxy` subresources. ([#66083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66083), [@jennybuckley](https://github.com/jennybuckley))
