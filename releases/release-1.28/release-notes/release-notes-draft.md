## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- CephFS volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/cephfs`) has been deprecated in this release and will be removed in a subsequent release. Alternative is to use CephFS CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. ([#118143](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118143), [@humblec](https://github.com/humblec)) [SIG Storage]
 - RBD volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/rbd`) has been deprecated in this release and will be removed in a subsequent release. Alternative is to use RBD CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. ([#118552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118552), [@humblec](https://github.com/humblec)) [SIG Storage]

### API Change

- ACTION_REQUIRED
  When an Indexed Job has a number of completions higher than 10^5 and parallelism higher than 10^4, and a big number of Indexes fail, Kubernetes might not be able to track the termination of the Job. Kubernetes now emits a warning, at Job creation, when the Job manifest exceeds both of these limits. ([#118420](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118420), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG Apps]
- Added a warning that TLS 1.3 ciphers are not configurable. ([#115399](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115399), [@3u13r](https://github.com/3u13r)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Added error handling for seccomp localhost configurations that do not properly set a localhostProfile ([#117020](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117020), [@cji](https://github.com/cji)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Added new config option `delayCacheUntilActive` to `KubeSchedulerConfiguration` that can provide a tradeoff between memory efficiency and scheduling speed when their leadership is updated in `kube-scheduler` ([#115754](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115754), [@linxiulei](https://github.com/linxiulei)) [SIG API Machinery and Scheduling]
- Client-go: Improved memory use of reflector caches when watching large numbers of objects which do not change frequently ([#113362](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113362), [@sxllwx](https://github.com/sxllwx)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Expose rest.DefaultServerUrlFor function ([#118055](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118055), [@timofurrer](https://github.com/timofurrer)) [SIG API Machinery]
- If using cgroups v2, then the cgroup aware OOM killer will be enabled for container cgroups via  `memory.oom.group` .  This causes processes within the cgroup to be treated as a unit and killed simultaneously in the event of an OOM kill on any process in the cgroup. ([#117793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117793), [@tzneal](https://github.com/tzneal)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- Kube-controller-manager: The `LegacyServiceAccountTokenCleanUp` feature gate is now available as alpha (off by default). When enabled, the `legacy-service-account-token-cleaner` controller loop removes service account token secrets that have not been used in the time specified by `--legacy-service-account-token-clean-up-period` (defaulting to one year), **and are** referenced from the `.secrets` list of a ServiceAccount object, **and are not** referenced from pods. ([#115554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115554), [@yt2985](https://github.com/yt2985)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Release and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler component config (KubeSchedulerConfiguration) kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2 is removed in v1.28. Migrate kube-scheduler configuration files to kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1. ([#117649](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117649), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG API Machinery, Scheduling and Testing]
- NodeVolumeLimits implement the PreFilter extension point for skipping the Filter phase if the Pod doesn't use volumes with limits. ([#115398](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115398), [@tangwz](https://github.com/tangwz)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Pods which set `hostNetwork: true` and declare ports get the `hostPort` field set automatically.  Previously this would happen in the PodTemplate of a Deployment, DaemonSet or other workload API.  Now `hostPort` will only be set when an actual Pod is being created.  If this presents a problem, setting the feature gate "DefaultHostNetworkHostPortsInWorkloads" to true will revert this behavior.  Please file a kubernetes bug if you need to do this. ([#117696](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117696), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG Apps]
- Removing WindowsHostProcessContainers feature-gate ([#117570](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117570), [@marosset](https://github.com/marosset)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node and Windows]

- Update the comment about the feature-gate level for PodFailurePolicy from alpha to beta ([#118278](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118278), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG Apps]

  generate http.Transports for the clients.
  
  - rest_client_transport_cache_entries is a gauge metric
  with the number of existin entries in the internal cache
  
  - rest_client_transport_create_calls_total is a counter
  that increments each time a new transport is created, storing
  the result of the operation needed to generate it: hit, miss
  or uncacheable ([#117295](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117295), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation, Network, Node and Testing]

- Graduated the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenTracking` feature gate to GA. The usage of auto-generated secret-based service account token now produces warnings, and relevant Secrets are labeled with a last-used timestamp (label key `kubernetes.io/legacy-token-last-used`). ([#117591](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117591), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Introduce support for CEL optionals (see [CEL spec proposal 246](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/wiki/proposal-246)).
  This feature will not be fully enabled until a future Kubernetes release (likely to be v1.29), but is added in v1.28 to enable
  safe rollback on downgrade. ([#118339](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118339), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Testing]

- Kube-proxy in iptables mode now has separate `sync_full_proxy_rules_duration_seconds`
  and `sync_partial_proxy_rules_duration_seconds` (in addition to the existing
  `sync_proxy_rules_duration_seconds`), to give better information about how long
  each sync type is taking, rather than only giving a weighted average of the two
  sync types together. ([#117787](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117787), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]
- Kubeadm: add a new "kubeadm config validate" command that can be used to validate any input config file. Use the --config flag to pass a config file to it. See the command --help screen for more information. As a result of adding this new command, enhance the validation capabilities of the existing "kubeadm config migrate" command. For both commands unknown APIs or fields will throw errors. ([#118013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118013), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
