  text: '[Dual-stack] Fixed `generateAPIPodStatus()` of kubelet handling Secondary
    IP. hostIPs order may not be consistent. If secondary IP is before primary one,
    current logic adds primary IP twice into `PodIPs`, which leads to error: "may
    specify no more than one IP for each IP family".'
