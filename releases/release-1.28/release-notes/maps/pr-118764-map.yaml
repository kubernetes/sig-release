    Added full cgroup v2 swap support for both `Limited` and `Unlimited` swap.

    When `LimitedSwap` is enabled the swap limit would be automatically calculated for
    Burstable QoS pods. For Best-Effort/Guaranteed QoS pods, swap would be disabled.

    Containers with memory requests equal to their memory limits also won't have
    swap access, and it is a way to opt-out of swap for a single container.

    The formula for the swap limit for Burstable QoS pods is:
    `(<memory-request>/<node-memory-capacity>)*<node-swap-capacity>`.

    Support for `cgroup v1` is removed.
