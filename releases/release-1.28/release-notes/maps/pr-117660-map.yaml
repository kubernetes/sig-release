    `kubeadm`: introduced a new feature gate `UpgradeAddonsBeforeControlPlane` to
    fix a kube-proxy skew policy misalignment. Its default value is `false`. Upgrade
    of the CoreDNS and kube-proxy addons will now trigger after all the control plane
    instances have been upgraded, unless the fearure gate is set to true. This feature
    gate will be removed in a future release.
