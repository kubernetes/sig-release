    client-go now exposes two new metrics to monitor the client-go logic that
    generate http.Transports for the clients.

    - `rest_client_transport_cache_entries` is a gauge metric
    with the number of existin entries in the internal cache

    - `rest_client_transport_create_calls_total` is a counter
    that increments each time a new transport is created, storing
    the result of the operation needed to generate it: hit, miss
    or uncacheable.
