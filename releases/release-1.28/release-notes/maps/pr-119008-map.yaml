    New Metrics Added for Encryption Configuration Controller

    This release adds new metrics to the Encryption Configuration Controller to help monitor the automatic reloading of encryption configuration. The new metrics include:

    - `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reload_failures_total`: Total number of failed automatic reloads of encryption configuration.
    - `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reload_success_total`: Total number of successful automatic reloads of encryption configuration.
    - `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_automatic_reload_last_timestamp_seconds`: Timestamp of the last successful or failed automatic reload of encryption configuration.

    These metrics can be used to monitor the health of the Encryption Configuration Controller and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during automatic reloading of encryption configuration.
