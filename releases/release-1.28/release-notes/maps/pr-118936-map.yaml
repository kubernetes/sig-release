  text: 'Dynamic resource allocation: when a claim uses "wait for first consumer"
    allocation (the default), then it will now get deallocated after it was used by
    a pod. That ensures that the next pod isn''t affected by previous scheduling decision
    and that resources are not kept allocated unless really needed. If keeping a claim
    allocated is desired, use "immediate allocation."'
