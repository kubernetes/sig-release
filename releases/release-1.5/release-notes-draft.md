## Known Issues

Populated via [v1.5.0 known issues / FAQ accumulator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37134)

* CRI [known issues and
  limitations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md#kubernetes-v15-release-cri-v1alpha1)
* getDeviceNameFromMount() function doesn't return the volume path correctly when the volume path contains spaces [#37712](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37712)
* Federation alpha features do not have feature gates defined and
are hence enabled by default. This will be fixed in a future release.
[#38593](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/38593)
* Federation control plane can be upgraded by updating the image
fields in the `Deployment` specs of the control plane components.
However, federation control plane upgrades were not tested in this
release [38537](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/38537)

## Notable Changes to Existing Behavior

* Node controller no longer force-deletes pods from the api-server. ([#35235](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35235), [@foxish](https://github.com/foxish))
  * For StatefulSet (previously PetSet), this change means creation of
    replacement pods is blocked until old pods are definitely not running
    (indicated either by the kubelet returning from partitioned state,
    deletion of the Node object, deletion of the instance in the cloud provider,
    or force deletion of the pod from the api-server).
    This helps prevent "split brain" scenarios in clustered applications by
    ensuring that unreachable pods will not be presumed dead unless some
    "fencing" operation has provided one of the above indications.
  * For all other existing controllers except StatefulSet, this has no effect on
    the ability of the controller to replace pods because the controllers do not
    reuse pod names (they use generate-name).
  * User-written controllers that reuse names of pod objects should evaluate this change.
  * When deleting an object with `kubectl delete ... --grace-period=0`, the client will 
    begin a graceful deletion and wait until the resource is fully deleted.  To force 
    deletion immediately, use the `--force` flag. This prevents users from accidentally 
    allowing two Stateful Set pods to share the same persistent volume which could lead to data 
    corruption [#37263](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37263)


* Allow anonymous API server access, decorate authenticated users with system:authenticated group ([#32386](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/32386), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  * kube-apiserver learned the '--anonymous-auth' flag, which defaults to true. When enabled, requests to the secure port that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of 'system:anonymous' and a group of 'system:unauthenticated'. 
  * Authenticated users are decorated with a 'system:authenticated' group.
  * NOTE: anonymous access is enabled by default. If you rely on authentication alone to authorize access, change to use an authorization mode other than AlwaysAllow, or or set '--anonymous-auth=false'.

* kubectl get -o jsonpath=... will now throw an error if the path is to a field not present in the json, even if the path is for a field valid for the type.  This is a change from the pre-1.5 behavior, which would return the default value for some fields even if they were not present in the json. ([#37991](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37991), [@pwittrock](http://github.com/pwittrock))

* The strategicmerge patchMergeKey for VolumeMounts was changed from "name" to "mountPath".  This was necessary because the name field refers to the name of the Volume, and is not a unique key for the VolumeMount.  Multiple VolumeMounts will have the same Volume name if mounting the same volume more than once.  The "mountPath" is verified to be unique and can act as the mergekey.  ([#35071](https://github.coma/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35071), [@pwittrock](http://github.com/pwittrock))

## Deprecations

* extensions/v1beta1.Jobs is deprecated, use batch/v1.Job instead ([#36355](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36355), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
* The kubelet --reconcile-cdir flag is deprecated because it has no function anymore. ([#35523](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35523), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Notice of deprecation for recycler [#36760](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36760)

## Action Required Before Upgrading

* batch/v2alpha1.ScheduledJob has been renamed, use batch/v2alpha1.CronJob instead ([#36021](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36021), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
* PetSet has been renamed to StatefulSet.
  If you have existing PetSets, **you must perform extra migration steps** both
  before and after upgrading to convert them to StatefulSets. ([docs](http://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-stateful-set/upgrade-pet-set-to-stateful-set/)) ([#35663](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35663), [@janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))
* If you are upgrading your Cluster Federation components from v1.4.x, please update your `federation-apiserver` and `federation-controller-manager` manifests to the new version ([#30601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/30601), [@madhusudancs](https://github.com/madhusudancs))
* The deprecated kubelet --configure-cbr0 flag has been removed, and with that the "classic" networking mode as well.  If you depend on this mode, please investigate whether the other network plugins `kubenet` or `cni` meet your needs. ([#34906](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34906), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* New client-go structure, refer to kubernetes/client-go for versioning policy ([#34989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34989), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
* The deprecated kube-scheduler --bind-pods-qps and --bind-pods burst flags have been removed, use --kube-api-qps and --kube-api-burst instead ([#34471](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34471), [@timothysc](https://github.com/timothysc))
* If you used the [PodDisruptionBudget](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/) feature in 1.4 (i.e. created `PodDisruptionBudget` objects), then **BEFORE**  upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5, you must delete all `PodDisruptionBudget` objects (`policy/v1alpha1/PodDisruptionBudget`) that you have created. It is not possible to delete these objects after you upgrade, and their presence will prevent you from using the beta PodDisruptionBudget feature in 1.5 (which uses `policy/v1beta1/PodDisruptionBudget`). If you have already upgraded, you will need to downgrade the master to 1.4 to delete the `policy/v1alpha1/PodDisruptionBudget` objects.

## External Dependency Version Information

Continuous integration builds have used the following versions of external dependencies, however, this is not a strong recommendation and users should consult an appropriate installation or upgrade guide before deciding what versions of etcd, docker or rkt to use. 

* Docker versions 1.10.3 - 1.12.3
  * Docker version 1.11.2 known issues
    - Kernel crash with Aufs storage driver on Debian Jessie ([#27885](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27885))
      which can be identified by the [node problem detector](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/node-problem/)
    - Leaked File descriptors ([#275](https://github.com/docker/containerd/issues/275))
    - Additional memory overhead per container ([#21737](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21737))
  * Docker version 1.12.1 [has been validated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/28698) through the Kubernetes docker automated validation framework as has Docker version 1.12.3 
 *  Docker 1.10.3 contains [backports provided by RedHat](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.10.3...runcom:docker-1.10.3-stable) for known issues
  * Docker versions as old as may 1.9.1 work with [known issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#191) but this is not guaranteed 
* rkt version 1.21.0
  * known issues with the rkt runtime are [listed here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/rkt/notes/)
* etcd version 2.2.1
  * etcd version 3.0.14 [has also been validated](https://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/builds/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/ci-kubernetes-e2e-gce-etcd3/) but does require [specific configuration steps](https://coreos.com/blog/migrating-applications-etcd-v3.html)
