  text: A pod that the Kubelet rejects was still considered as being accepted for
    a brief period of time after rejection, which might cause some pods to be rejected
    briefly that could fit on the node.  A pod that is still terminating (but has
    status indicating it has failed) may also still be consuming resources and so
    should also be considered.
