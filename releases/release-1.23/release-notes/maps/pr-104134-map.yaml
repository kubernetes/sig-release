  text: 'kubeadm: When adding an etcd peer to an existing cluster, if an error is
    returned indicating the peer has already been added, this is accepted and a `ListMembers`
    call is used instead to return the existing cluster. This helps to diminish the
    exponential backoff when the first AddMember call times out, while still retaining
    a similar performance when the peer has already been added from a previous call.'
