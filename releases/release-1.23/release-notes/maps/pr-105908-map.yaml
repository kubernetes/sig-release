    The Pods and Pod controllers that are exempted from the PodSecurity admission process are now marked with the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/exempt: user/namespace/runtimeClass` annotation, based on what caused the exemption.

    The enforcement level that allowed or denied a Pod during PodSecurity admission is now marked by the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-policy` annotation.

    The annotation that informs about audit policy violations changed from `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit` to `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-violation`.
