  text: 'kubeadm: external etcd endpoints passed in the `ClusterConfiguration` that
    have Unicode characters are no longer IDNA encoded (converted to Punycode). They
    are now just URL encoded as per Go''s implementation of RFC-3986, have duplicate
    "/" removed from the URL paths, and passed like that directly to the `kube-apiserver`
    `--etcd-servers` flag. If you have etcd endpoints that have Unicode characters,
    it is advisable to encode them in advance with tooling that is fully IDNA compliant.
    If you don''t do that, the Go standard library (used in k8s and etcd) would do
    it for you when making requests to the endpoints.'
