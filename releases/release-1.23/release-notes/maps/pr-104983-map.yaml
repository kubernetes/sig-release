    The kube-apiserver's Prometheus metrics have been extended with some that describe the costs of handling LIST requests.  They are as follows.
    - *apiserver_cache_list_total*: Counter of LIST requests served from watch cache, broken down by resource_prefix and index_name
    - *apiserver_cache_list_fetched_objects_total*: Counter of objects read from watch cache in the course of serving a LIST request, broken down by resource_prefix and index_name
    - *apiserver_cache_list_evaluated_objects_total*: Counter of objects tested in the course of serving a LIST request from watch cache, broken down by resource_prefix
    - *apiserver_cache_list_returned_objects_total*: Counter of objects returned for a LIST request from watch cache, broken down by resource_prefix
    - *apiserver_storage_list_total*: Counter of LIST requests served from etcd, broken down by resource
    - *apiserver_storage_list_fetched_objects_total*: Counter of objects read from etcd in the course of serving a LIST request, broken down by resource
    - *apiserver_storage_list_evaluated_objects_total*: Counter of objects tested in the course of serving a LIST request from etcd, broken down by resource
    - *apiserver_storage_list_returned_objects_total*: Counter of objects returned for a LIST request from etcd, broken down by resource
