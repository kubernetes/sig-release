    Introduce a feature gate `DisableKubeletCloudCredentialProviders` which allows disabling the in-tree kubelet credential providers.

    The feature gate `DisableKubeletCloudCredentialProviders` is currently in Alpha, which means is currently disabled by default. Once this feature gate moves to beta, in-tree credential providers will be disabled by default, and users will need to migrate to use external credential providers.
