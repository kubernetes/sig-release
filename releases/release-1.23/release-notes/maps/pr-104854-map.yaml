  text: 'kubeadm: switch the preflight check (called ''Swap'') that verifies if swap
    is enabled on Linux hosts to report a warning instead of an error. This is related
    to the graduation of the NodeSwap feature gate in the kubelet to Beta and being
    enabled by default in 1.23 - allows swap support on Linux hosts. In the next release
    of kubeadm (1.24) the preflight check will be removed, thus we recommend that
    you stop using it - e.g. via `--ignore-preflight-errors` or the kubeadm config.'
