## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated flag `--experimental-patches` for the `init|join|upgrade` commands. The flag `--patches` is no longer allowed in a mixture with the flag `--config`. Please use the kubeadm configuration for setting patches for a node using `{Init|Join}Configuration.patches`. ([#104065](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104065), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
 - Support for the seccomp annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/[name]` has been deprecated since 1.19, will be dropped in 1.25. Transition to using the `seccompProfile` API field. ([#104389](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104389), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

### API Change

- A small regression in Service updates was fixed.  The circumstances are so unlikely that probably nobody would ever hit it. ([#104601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104601), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Client-go impersonation config can specify a UID to pass impersonated uid information through in requests. ([#104483](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104483), [@margocrawf](https://github.com/margocrawf))
- Ephemeral containers have reached beta maturity and are now available by default. ([#105405](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105405), [@verb](https://github.com/verb)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- If a conflict occurs when creating an object with `generateName`, the server now returns an "AlreadyExists" error with a retry option. ([#104699](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104699), [@vincepri](https://github.com/vincepri))
- Introduce OS field in the Pod Spec ([#104693](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104693), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]

- Introduce v1beta3 api for scheduler. This version 
  - increases the weight of user specifiable priorities.
  The weights of following priority plugins are increased
    - TaintTolerations to 3 - as leveraging node tainting to group nodes in the cluster is becoming a widely-adopted practice
    - NodeAffinity to 2
    - InterPodAffinity to 2
  
  - Won't have HealthzBindAddress, MetricsBindAddress fields ([#104251](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104251), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- JSON log output is configurable and now supports writing info messages to stdout and error messages to stderr. Info messages can be buffered in memory. The default is to write both to stdout without buffering, as before. ([#104873](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104873), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Node and Scheduling]
- JobTrackingWithFinalizers graduates to beta. Feature is enabled by default. ([#105687](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105687), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG Apps and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Fixes handling of CRD schemas containing literal null values in enums. ([#104969](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104969), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-apiserver: The `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API version is removed; use the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API, available since v1.8.

([#104248](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104248), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-scheduler: support for configuration file version `v1beta1` is removed. Update configuration files to v1beta2(xref: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2901) or v1beta3 before upgrading to 1.23. ([#104782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104782), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]

- Kubernetes is now built using go 1.17. ([#103692](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103692), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus))
- Promote `IPv6DualStack` feature to stable.
  Controller Manager flags for the node IPAM controller have slightly changed:
  1. When configuring a dual-stack cluster, the user must specify both `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` and `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6` to set the per-node IP mask sizes, instead of the previous `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag.
  2. The `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag is mutually exclusive with `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` and `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6`.
  3. Single-stack clusters do not need to change, but may choose to use the more specific flags.  Users can use either the older `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag or one of the newer `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` or `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6` flags to configure the per-node IP mask size, provided that the flag's IP family matches the cluster's IP family (--cluster-cidr). ([#104691](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104691), [@khenidak](https://github.com/khenidak))
- Remove NodeLease feature gate that was graduated and locked to stable in 1.17 release. ([#105222](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105222), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- Removed deprecated `--seccomp-profile-root`/`seccompProfileRoot` config. ([#103941](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103941), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Since golang 1.17 both net.ParseIP and net.ParseCIDR rejects leading zeros in the dot-decimal notation of IPv4 addresses,
  Kubernetes will keep allowing leading zeros on IPv4 address to not break the compatibility.
  IMPORTANT: Kubernetes interprets leading zeros on IPv4 addresses as decimal, users must not rely on parser alignment to not being impacted by the associated security advisory:
  CVE-2021-29923 golang standard library "net" - Improper Input Validation of octal literals in golang 1.16.2 and below standard library "net" results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities.
  Reference: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29923 ([#104368](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104368), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))

- The `CSIDriver.Spec.StorageCapacity` can now be modified. ([#101789](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101789), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- The `Service.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` field is now *required* in order to create or update a Service as dual-stack.  This is a breaking change from the beta behavior.  Previously the server would try to infer the value of that field from either `ipFamilies` or `clusterIPs`, but that caused ambiguity on updates.  Users who want a dual-stack Service MUST specify `ipFamilyPolicy` as either "PreferDualStack" or "RequireDualStack". ([#96684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96684), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- The `kube-controller-manager` supports `--concurrent-ephemeralvolume-syncs` flag to set the number of ephemeral volume controller workers. ([#102981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102981), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- The legacy scheduler policy config is removed in v1.23, the associated flags policy-config-file, policy-configmap, policy-configmap-namespace and use-legacy-policy-config are also removed.

([#104915](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104915), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI and Testing]
- Users of `LogFormatRegistry` in component-base must update their code to use the logr v1.0.0 API. The JSON log output now uses the format from go-logr/zapr (no `v` field for error messages, additional information for invalid calls) and has some fixes (correct source code location for warnings about invalid log calls). ([#104103](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104103), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))

- The test "[sig-network] EndpointSlice should have Endpoints and EndpointSlices pointing to API Server [Conformance]" only requires that there is an EndpointSlice that references the "kubernetes.default" service, it no longer requires that its named "kubernetes". ([#104664](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104664), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Update description of `--audit-log-maxbackup` to describe behavior when `value = 0`. ([#103843](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103843), [@Arkessler](https://github.com/Arkessler))

### Failing Test

- Fixes hostpath storage e2e tests within SELinux enabled env ([#104551](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104551), [@Elbehery](https://github.com/Elbehery)) [SIG Testing]

### Bug or Regression

- A pod that the Kubelet rejects was still considered as being accepted for a brief period of time after rejection, which might cause some pods to be rejected briefly that could fit on the node.  A pod that is still terminating (but has status indicating it has failed) may also still be consuming resources and so should also be considered.

- Kubeadm: When adding an etcd peer to an existing cluster, if an error is returned indicating the peer has already been added, this is accepted and a `ListMembers` call is used instead to return the existing cluster. This helps to diminish the exponential backoff when the first AddMember call times out, while still retaining a similar performance when the peer has already been added from a previous call.

- Kubeadm: switch the preflight check (called 'Swap') that verifies if swap is enabled on Linux hosts to report a warning instead of an error. This is related to the graduation of the NodeSwap feature gate in the kubelet to Beta and being enabled by default in 1.23 - allows swap support on Linux hosts. In the next release of kubeadm (1.24) the preflight check will be removed, thus we recommend that you stop using it - e.g. via `--ignore-preflight-errors` or the kubeadm config.

- XFS-filesystems are now force-formatted (option `-f`) in order to avoid problems being formatted due to detection of magic super-blocks. This aligns with the behaviour of formatting of ext3/4 filesystems. ([#104923](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104923), [@davidkarlsen](https://github.com/davidkarlsen))
- `--log-flush-frequency` had no effect in several commands or was missing. Help and warning texts were not always using the right format for a command (`add_dir_header` instead of `add-dir-header`). Fixing this included cleaning up flag handling in component-base/logs: that package no longer adds flags to the global flag sets. Commands which want the klog and --log-flush-frequency flags must explicitly call logs.AddFlags; the new cli.Run does that for commands. That helper function also covers flag normalization and printing of usage and errors in a consistent way (print usage text first if parsing failed, then the error).

- Kubeadm: external etcd endpoints passed in the `ClusterConfiguration` that have Unicode characters are no longer IDNA encoded (converted to Punycode). They are now just URL encoded as per Go's implementation of RFC-3986, have duplicate "/" removed from the URL paths, and passed like that directly to the `kube-apiserver` `--etcd-servers` flag. If you have etcd endpoints that have Unicode characters, it is advisable to encode them in advance with tooling that is fully IDNA compliant. If you don't do that, the Go standard library (used in k8s and etcd) would do it for you when making requests to the endpoints.
