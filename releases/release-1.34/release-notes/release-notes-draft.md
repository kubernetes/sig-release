## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- For metrics `apiserver_cache_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_total` replace `resource_prefix` label with API `group` and `resource` labels.
  For metrics `etcd_request_duration_seconds`, `etcd_requests_total` and `etcd_request_errors_total` replace `type` label with API `resource` and `group` label.
  For metric `apiserver_selfrequest_total` add a API `group` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_watch_events_sizes` and `apiserver_watch_events_total` replace API `kind` label with `resource` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_request_body_size_bytes`, `apiserver_storage_events_received_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_evaluated_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_dispatched_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_received_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_initializations_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_resource_version`, `watch_cache_capacity`, `apiserver_init_events_total`, `apiserver_terminated_watchers_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_increase_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_decrease_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_read_wait_seconds`, `apiserver_watch_cache_consistent_read_total`, `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total`, `etcd_bookmark_counts`, `storage_decode_errors_total` extract the API group from `resource` label and put it in new `group` label. ([#131845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131845), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd, Instrumentation and Testing]
 - Kubelet:  removed the deprecated flag `--cloud-config` from the command line. ([#130161](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130161), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Node and Scalability]
 - The Scheduling Framework exposed `NodeInfos` to the PreFilter plugins. The PreFilter plugins now accepted the `NodeInfo` list from the arguments. ([#130720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130720), [@saintube](https://github.com/saintube)) [SIG Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]

- Kubeadm: Consistently prefixed errors with error: when printing them. ([#132080](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132080), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Exposed only the non-deprecated klog flags (-v and -vmodule), in line with KEP https://features.k8s.io/2845. ([#131647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131647), [@carsontham](https://github.com/carsontham))
- [cloud-provider] Respected the `exclude-from-external-load-balancers=false` label. ([#131085](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131085), [@kayrus](https://github.com/kayrus)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Network]

### API Change

- Added `omitempty` and `opt` tag to the API `v1beta2` AdminAccess type in the `DeviceRequestAllocationResult` struct. ([#132338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132338), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Added a `runtime.ApplyConfiguration` interface implemented by all generated apply configuration types. ([#132194](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132194), [@alvaroaleman](https://github.com/alvaroaleman)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Added support for specifying `controlplane` or `cluster` egress selectors in JWT authenticators via the `issuer.egressSelectorType` field in the `AuthenticationConfiguration.jwt` array. If unset, the previous behavior of using no egress selector is preserved. This functionality requires the `StructuredAuthenticationConfigurationEgressSelector` beta feature gate (enabled by default). ([#132768](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132768), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Corrected the documentation to clarify that `podSelector` is optional and described its default behavior. ([#131354](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131354), [@tomoish](https://github.com/tomoish))
- DRA API: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3 now only contains DeviceTaintRule. All other types got removed because they became obsolete when introducing the v1beta1 API in 1.32.
  before updating a cluster where resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, deviceclasses, or resourceslices might have been stored using Kubernetes < 1.32, delete all of those resources before updating and recreate them as needed while running Kubernetes >= 1.32. ([#132000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132000), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, the alpha-level `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` label has been updated to `resource.kubernetes.io/admin-access`. Admins using the alpha feature and updating from 1.33 can set both labels, upgrade, then remove `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` when no downgrade is going to happen anymore. ([#131996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131996), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- DRA: removed support for the v1alpha4 kubelet gRPC API (added in 1.31, superseded in 1.32). DRA drivers using the helper package from Kubernetes  >= 1.32 use the v1beta1 API and continue to be supported. ([#132574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132574), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Deprecated `StreamingConnectionIdleTimeout` field of the kubelet config. ([#131992](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131992), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375))

- Introduced OpenAPI format support for `k8s-short-name` and `k8s-long-name` in CustomResourceDefinition schemas. ([#132504](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132504), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Kube-apiserver: Added support for disabling caching of authorization webhook decisions in the `--authorization-config` file. The new fields `cacheAuthorizedRequests` and `cacheUnauthorizedRequests` could be set to `false` to prevent caching for authorized or unauthorized requests. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#using-configuration-file-for-authorization for more details.

- Kube-apiserver: the AuthenticationConfiguration type accepted in `--authentication-config` files has been promoted to `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1`. ([#131752](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131752), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-log-runner: Added the `-log-file-size` parameter to rotate log output into a new file once it reached a certain size. Introduced `-log-file-age` to enable automatic removal of old output files, and `-flush-interval` to support periodic flushing. ([#127667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127667), [@zylxjtu](https://github.com/zylxjtu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]
- Kubectl: Graduated kuberc support to beta. A `kuberc` configuration file provided a mechanism for customizing `kubectl` behavior (distinct from kubeconfig, which configures cluster access across different clients). ([#131818](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131818), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Promoted Job Pod Replacement Policy to general availability. The `JobPodReplacementPolicy` feature gate was locked to `true` and will be removed in a future Kubernetes release.

- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the component-base. ([#132754](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132754), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the kube-aggregator apiregistration. ([#132701](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132701), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Simplied validation error message for invalid fields by removing redundant field name. ([#132513](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132513), [@xiaoweim](https://github.com/xiaoweim)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node and Scheduling]
- Simplied validation error message for required fields by removing redundant messages. ([#132472](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132472), [@xiaoweim](https://github.com/xiaoweim)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Cloud Provider, Network, Node and Storage]
- TBD ([#131318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131318), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Network and Testing]
- The validation of `replicas` field in the ReplicationController `/scale` subresource has been migrated to declarative validation.
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate is enabled, declarative validation is the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#131664](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131664), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- The validation-gen code generator generated validation code that supported validation ratcheting. ([#132236](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132236), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Node]
- Updated `IsDNS1123SubdomainWithUnderscore` so that, when it returned an error, it also returned the correct regex information (`dns1123SubdomainFmtWithUnderscore`). ([#132034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132034), [@ChosenFoam](https://github.com/ChosenFoam))
- Updated etcd version to v3.6.0. ([#131501](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131501), [@joshjms](https://github.com/joshjms)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd and Testing]
- Updated the `v1` credential provider configuration to include the `tokenAttributes.cacheType` field.

### Feature

- Added Traffic Distribution field to `kubectl describe service` output ([#131491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131491), [@tchap](https://github.com/tchap)) [SIG CLI]
- Added `SizeBasedListCostEstimate` feature gate that allowed apiserver to estimate sizes of objects to calculate cost of LIST requests. ([#132355](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132355), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery and Etcd]
- Added a `--show-swap` option to `kubectl top` subcommands ([#129458](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129458), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG CLI]
- Added a delay to node updates after kubelet startup. A random offset, based on the configured `nodeStatusReportFrequency`, helped distribute traffic and load from node status updates more evenly over time. The initial status update could occur up to 50% earlier or later than the regular schedule. ([#130919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130919), [@mengqiy](https://github.com/mengqiy))
- Added a flag to kubectl version to detect whether a client/server version mismatch was outside the officially supported range. ([#127365](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127365), [@omerap12](https://github.com/omerap12))

- Added support for CEL expressions with escaped names in the structured authentication config. Using `[...]` to access claims or user data was recommended when names contained characters that would otherwise need escaping. CEL optionals with `?` could be used where has was not applicable — for example, `claims[?"kubernetes.io"]` or `user.extra[?"domain.io/foo"]`. ([#131574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131574), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Added support for `--cpu`, `--memory` flag to `kubectl autoscale`, started deprecating `--cpu-precent`. ([#129373](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129373), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025))
- Added the `DetectCacheInconsistency` feature gate, allowing the API server to periodically verify consistency between its `cache` and `etcd`. Detected inconsistencies reported via the `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total` metric and trigger purging of affected cache snapshots. ([#132884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132884), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Added the `SizeBasedListCostEstimate` feature gate (enabled by default), which changes how APF seats are assigned to `LIST` requests. With this feature, one seat is assigned per 100KB of data loaded into memory at once during a `LIST` operation. ([#132932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132932), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Built Kubernetes using Go 1.24.3. ([#131934](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131934), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Built Kubernetes using Go 1.24.4. ([#132222](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132222), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- DRA kubelet: Fixed the kubelet to also clean up `ResourceSlices` in some additional failure scenarios (driver was removed forcibly or crashed and did not restart). ([#132058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132058), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Enabled compact snapshots in the watch cache based on `etcd` compaction events. ([#132876](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132876), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery and Etcd]
- Enabled completion for aliases defined in `kubectlrc`. ([#131586](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131586), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Ensured that non-scheduling related errors (e.g., network errors) did not lengthen the Pod scheduling backoff time. ([#128748](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128748), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated `ResilientWatchCacheInitialization` to GA. ([#131979](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131979), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated `StreamingCollectionEncodingToJSON` and `StreamingCollectionEncodingToProtobuf` to GA. ([#132648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132648), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated configurable endpoints for anonymous authentication using the authentication configuration file to stable. ([#131654](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131654), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Graduated relaxed DNS search string validation to GA. For the Pod API, `.spec.dnsConfig.searches`
  now allows an underscore (`_`) where a dash (`-`) would be allowed, and it allows search strings be a single dot `.`. ([#132036](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132036), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Graduated scheduler `QueueingHint` support to GA (general availability) ([#131973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131973), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]

([#132342](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132342), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Included the namespace in the output of `kubectl delete` for better identification of resources. ([#126619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126619), [@totegamma](https://github.com/totegamma))
- Kube-apiserver: Each unique set of etcd server overrides specified with `--etcd-servers-overrides` surfaced health checks named `etcd-override-<index>` and `etcd-override-readiness-<index>`. These checks were still excluded by the `?exclude=etcd` and `?exclude=etcd-readiness` directives. ([#129438](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129438), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature to beta, which enabled external signing of service account tokens and fetching of public verifying keys. This was accomplished by enabling the beta `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature gate and specifying the `--service-account-signing-endpoint` flag. The flag value could either be the path to a Unix domain socket on the filesystem, or be prefixed with @ to indicate a Unix domain socket in the abstract namespace. ([#131300](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131300), [@HarshalNeelkamal](https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-proxy: Checked whether IPv6 was available on Linux before using it. ([#131265](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131265), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz))

- Kubeadm: graduated the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate to beta and enabed it by default. When its enabled, kubeadm will:
    1. Generate a `/var/lib/kubelet/instance-config.yaml` file to customize the `containerRuntimeEndpoint` field in per-node kubelet configurations.
    2. Remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from nodes during upgrade operations.
    3. Remove the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file during upgrades. ([#131981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131981), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: graduated the kubeadm specific feature gate `WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents` to GA. The feature gate is was locked to always be enabled and on node initialization kubeadm performed a health check for all control plane components and not only the `kube-apiserver`. ([#132594](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132594), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: switched the validation check for Linux kernel version to throw warnings instead of errors. ([#131919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131919), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- Kubelet: Extended the `--image-credential-provider-config` flag to accept a directory path in addition to a single file. When a directory was specified, all .json, .yaml, and .yml files in that directory were loaded and merged in lexicographical order. ([#131658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131658), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- LeaseLocks could now have custom labels that different holders would overwrite when they became the holder of the underlying lease. ([#131632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131632), [@DerekFrank](https://github.com/DerekFrank))
- Migrated validation in `CertificateSigningRequest` to use declarative validation. When the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics. If `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` is enabled, declarative validation becomes the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#132361](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132361), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Promoted the Ordered Namespace Deletion test to Conformance. ([#132219](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132219), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture and Testing]
- Promoted the feature `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` to GA. ([#131514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131514), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Removed "endpoint-controller" and "workload-leader-election" FlowSchemas from the default APF configuration.
  
  migrate the lock type used in the leader election in your workloads from configmapsleases/endpointsleases to leases. ([#131215](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131215), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network, Scalability and Scheduling]
- Static pods that reference API objects have been denied admission by the kubelet so that static pods would not be silently running even after the mirror pod creation fails. ([#131837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131837), [@sreeram-venkitesh](https://github.com/sreeram-venkitesh)) [SIG Auth, Node and Testing]
- The Kubernetes API server merged selectors built from `matchLabelKeys` into the `labelSelector` of `topologySpreadConstraints`, aligning Pod Topology Spread behavior with Inter-Pod Affinity. To prevent breaking existing Pods using `matchLabelKeys`, this scheduler behavior was preserved until v1.34. Upgrades from v1.32 to v1.34 should be done incrementally (v1.32 → v1.33 → v1.34), ensuring Pods created at v1.32 with `matchLabelKeys` are scheduled before reaching v1.34. Controllers relying on `matchLabelKeys` no longer need to handle them directly and can use `labelSelector` instead. The new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge`, enabled by default, controls this behavior.
