### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- For metrics `apiserver_cache_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_total` replace `resource_prefix` label with API `group` and `resource` labels.
  For metrics `etcd_request_duration_seconds`, `etcd_requests_total` and `etcd_request_errors_total` replace `type` label with API `resource` and `group` label.
  For metric `apiserver_selfrequest_total` add a API `group` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_watch_events_sizes` and `apiserver_watch_events_total` replace API `kind` label with `resource` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_request_body_size_bytes`, `apiserver_storage_events_received_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_evaluated_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_dispatched_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_received_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_initializations_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_resource_version`, `watch_cache_capacity`, `apiserver_init_events_total`, `apiserver_terminated_watchers_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_increase_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_decrease_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_read_wait_seconds`, `apiserver_watch_cache_consistent_read_total`, `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total`, `etcd_bookmark_counts`, `storage_decode_errors_total` extract the API group from `resource` label and put it in new `group` label. ([#131845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131845), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd, Instrumentation and Testing]
 - Kubelet:  Removed the deprecated flag `--cloud-config` from the command line. ([#130161](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130161), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
 - Static pods that reference API objects were denied admission by the kubelet so that static pods would not be silently running even after the mirror pod creation failed. ([#131837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131837), [@sreeram-venkitesh](https://github.com/sreeram-venkitesh))
 - The Scheduling Framework exposed `NodeInfos` to the PreFilter plugins. The PreFilter plugins now accepted the `NodeInfo` list from the arguments. ([#130720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130720), [@saintube](https://github.com/saintube))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Apimachinery: Deprecated `MessageCountMap` and `CreateAggregateFromMessageCountMap`. ([#132376](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132376), [@tico88612](https://github.com/tico88612))
- DRA kubelet: gRPC API graduated to v1, v1beta1 was deprecated starting in 1.34. Updating DRA drivers to the `k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/kubeletplugin` helper from 1.34 added support for both API versions. ([#132700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132700), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Deprecated the `preferences` field in kubeconfig in favor of `kuberc`. ([#131741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131741), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- Kubeadm: Consistently prefixed errors with error: when printing them. ([#132080](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132080), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Exposed only the non-deprecated klog flags (-v and -vmodule), in line with KEP https://features.k8s.io/2845. ([#131647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131647), [@carsontham](https://github.com/carsontham))
- [cloud-provider] Respected the `exclude-from-external-load-balancers=false` label. ([#131085](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131085), [@kayrus](https://github.com/kayrus))

### API Change

- Added `omitempty` and `opt` tag to the API `v1beta2` AdminAccess type in the `DeviceRequestAllocationResult` struct. ([#132338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132338), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Added a `runtime.ApplyConfiguration` interface implemented by all generated apply configuration types. ([#132194](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132194), [@alvaroaleman](https://github.com/alvaroaleman))
- Added a detailed event for in-place pod vertical scaling completed, improving cluster management and debugging. ([#130387](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130387), [@shiya0705](https://github.com/shiya0705))
- Added a mechanism for configurable container restarts: _container-level restart rules_. This was an alpha feature behind the `ContainerRestartRules` feature gate. ([#132642](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132642), [@yuanwang04](https://github.com/yuanwang04))
- Added a new `FileKeyRef` field to containers, allowing them to load variables from files by setting this field.
  
  Introduced the `EnvFiles` feature gate to govern activation of this functionality. ([#132626](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132626), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Added driver-owned fields in `ResourceSlice` to mark whether the device was shareable among multiple resource claims (or requests) and to specify how each capacity could be shared between different requests.
  - Added user-owned fields in `ResourceClaim` to specify resource requirements against each device capacity.
  - Added scheduler-owned field in `ResourceClaim.Status` to specify how much device capacity is reserved for a specific request.
  - Added an additional identifier to `ResourceClaim.Status` for the device supports multiple allocations.
  - Added a new constraint type to enforce uniqueness of specified attributes across all allocated devices. ([#132522](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132522), [@sunya-ch](https://github.com/sunya-ch))
- Added new optional APIs in `ResouceSlice.Basic` and `ResourceClaim.Status.AllocatedDeviceStatus`. ([#130160](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130160), [@KobayashiD27](https://github.com/KobayashiD27))
- Added support for specifying `controlplane` or `cluster` egress selectors in JWT authenticators via the `issuer.egressSelectorType` field in the `AuthenticationConfiguration.jwt` array. If unset, the previous behavior of using no egress selector is preserved. This functionality requires the `StructuredAuthenticationConfigurationEgressSelector` beta feature gate (enabled by default). ([#132768](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132768), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))
- Added support in the Kubelet for monitoring the health of devices allocated via Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) and report it in the `pod.status.containerStatuses.allocatedResourcesStatus` field. This required the DRA plugin to implement the new v1alpha1 `NodeHealth` gRPC service. This feature was controlled by the `ResourceHealthStatus` feature gate. ([#130606](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130606), [@Jpsassine](https://github.com/Jpsassine))
- Added support in the kubelet's image pull credential tracking for service account-based verification. When an image was pulled using service account credentials via external credential providers, subsequent Pods using the same service account (UID, name, and namespace) could access the cached image without re-authentication for the lifetime of that service account. ([#132771](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132771), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- Added validation to reject Pods using the `PodLevelResources` feature on Windows OS due to lack of support. The API server rejected Pods with pod-level resources and a `Pod.spec.os.name` targeting Windows. Kubelet on nodes running Windows also rejected Pods with pod-level resources at the admission phase. ([#133046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133046), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus))
- Added warnings when creating headless service with set `loadBalancerIP`,`externalIPs` and/or `SessionAffinity`. ([#132214](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132214), [@Peac36](https://github.com/Peac36))
- Allowed `pvc.spec.VolumeAttributesClassName` to change from non-nil to nil. ([#132106](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132106), [@AndrewSirenko](https://github.com/AndrewSirenko))
- Allowed setting the `hostnameOverride` field in `PodSpec` to specify any RFC 1123 DNS subdomain as the pod's hostname. The `HostnameOverride` feature gate was introduced to control enablement of this functionality. ([#132558](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132558), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Changed underlying logic for `Eviction Manager` helper functions. ([#132277](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132277), [@KevinTMtz](https://github.com/KevinTMtz))
- Changed underlying logic to propagate pod-level hugepage cgroup to containers when they did not specify hugepage resources.
  - Added validation to enforce the hugepage aggregated container limits to be smaller than or equal to pod-level limits. This was already enforced with the defaulted requests from the specified limits, however it did not make it clear about both hugepage requests and limits. ([#131089](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131089), [@KevinTMtz](https://github.com/KevinTMtz))
- Corrected the documentation to clarify that `podSelector` is optional and described its default behavior. ([#131354](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131354), [@tomoish](https://github.com/tomoish))
- DRA API: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3 now only contains DeviceTaintRule. All other types got removed because they became obsolete when introducing the v1beta1 API in 1.32.
  before updating a cluster where resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, deviceclasses, or resourceslices might have been stored using Kubernetes < 1.32, delete all of those resources before updating and recreate them as needed while running Kubernetes >= 1.32. ([#132000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132000), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, the alpha-level `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` label has been updated to `resource.kubernetes.io/admin-access`. Admins using the alpha feature and updating from 1.33 can set both labels, upgrade, then remove `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` when no downgrade is going to happen anymore. ([#131996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131996), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh))
- DRA: The scheduler plugin prevented abnormal filter runtimes by timing out after 10 seconds. This was configurable via the plugin configuration's `FilterTimeout`. Setting it to zero disabled the timeout and restored the behavior of Kubernetes <= 1.33. ([#132033](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132033), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- DRA: When the prioritized list feature was used in a request and the resulting number of allocated devices exceeded the number of allowed devices per claim, the scheduler aborted the attempt to allocate devices early. Previously, it tried to many different combinations, which could take a long time. ([#130593](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130593), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent))
- DRA: removed support for the v1alpha4 kubelet gRPC API (added in 1.31, superseded in 1.32). DRA drivers using the helper package from Kubernetes  >= 1.32 use the v1beta1 API and continue to be supported. ([#132574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132574), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Deprecated `StreamingConnectionIdleTimeout` field of the kubelet config. ([#131992](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131992), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375))
- Dynamic Resource Allocation: Graduated core functionality to general availability (GA). This newly stable feature uses the _structured parameters_ flavor of DRA. ([#132706](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132706), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Enabled kube-apiserver support for `PodCertificateRequest` and `PodCertificate` projected volumes (behind the `PodCertificateRequest` feature gate). ([#128010](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128010), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd))
- Extended resources backed by DRA feature allowed cluster operator to specify `extendedResourceName` in `DeviceClass`, and application operator to continue using extended resources in pod's requests to request for DRA devices matching the DeviceClass.
  
  `NodeResourcesFit` plugin scoring didn't work for extended resources backed by DRA. ([#130653](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130653), [@yliaog](https://github.com/yliaog))
- Extended the NodePorts scheduling plugin to consider hostPorts used by restartable init containers. ([#132040](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132040), [@avrittrohwer](https://github.com/avrittrohwer))
- Fixed a 1.33 regression that causes a nil panic in kube-scheduler when aggregating resource requested across container's spec and status. ([#132895](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132895), [@yue9944882](https://github.com/yue9944882))
- Fixed prerelease lifecycle for `PodCertificateRequest`. ([#133350](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133350), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Introduced OpenAPI format support for `k8s-short-name` and `k8s-long-name` in CustomResourceDefinition schemas. ([#132504](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132504), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Introduced the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/MutatingAdmissionPolicy` API type. To enable, enable the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate (which was off by default) and set `--runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=true` on the kube-apiserver. 
  Note that the default stored version remained alpha in 1.34, and whoever enabled beta during 1.34 needed to run a storage migration yourself to ensure you don't depend on alpha data in etcd. ([#132821](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132821), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37))
- Kube-apiserver: Added support for disabling caching of authorization webhook decisions in the `--authorization-config` file. The new fields `cacheAuthorizedRequests` and `cacheUnauthorizedRequests` could be set to `false` to prevent caching for authorized or unauthorized requests. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#using-configuration-file-for-authorization for more details. ([#129237](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129237), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke))
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `StructuredAuthenticationConfiguration` feature gate to GA. ([#131916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131916), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: the AuthenticationConfiguration type accepted in `--authentication-config` files has been promoted to `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1`. ([#131752](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131752), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-log-runner: Added the `-log-file-size` parameter to rotate log output into a new file once it reached a certain size. Introduced `-log-file-age` to enable automatic removal of old output files, and `-flush-interval` to support periodic flushing. ([#127667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127667), [@zylxjtu](https://github.com/zylxjtu))
- Kubectl: Graduated kuberc support to beta. A `kuberc` configuration file provided a mechanism for customizing `kubectl` behavior (distinct from kubeconfig, which configures cluster access across different clients). ([#131818](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131818), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- Promoted Job Pod Replacement Policy to general availability. The `JobPodReplacementPolicy` feature gate was locked to `true` and will be removed in a future Kubernetes release. ([#132173](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132173), [@dejanzele](https://github.com/dejanzele))

- Promoted feature-gate `VolumeAttributesClass` to GA
  - Promoted API `VolumeAttributesClass` and `VolumeAttributesClassList` to `storage.k8s.io/v1`. ([#131549](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131549), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Etcd, Storage and Testing]
- Promoted the `APIServerTracing` feature gate to GA. The `--tracing-config-file` flag accepted `TracingConfiguration` in version `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1` (with no changes from `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1`). ([#132340](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132340), [@dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole))
- Promoted the `AuthorizeWithSelectors` and `AuthorizeNodeWithSelectors` feature gates to stable and locked on. ([#132656](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132656), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Promoted the `KubeletTracing` feature gate to GA. ([#132341](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132341), [@dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole)) [SIG Instrumentation and Node]
- Promoted the `RelaxedEnvironmentVariableValidation` feature gate to GA and locked it in the enabled state by default. ([#132054](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132054), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Removed an inaccurate statement about requiring ports when the Pod spec `hostNetwork` field was set. ([#130994](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130994), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder))
- Removed deprecated `gogo` protocol definitions from `k8s.io/kubelet/pkg/apis/pluginregistration` in favor of `google.golang.org/protobuf`. ([#132773](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132773), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Removed deprecated gogo protocol definitions from `k8s.io/cri-api` in favor of `google.golang.org/protobuf`. ([#128653](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128653), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Instrumentation, Node and Testing]
- Replaced Boolean-pointer-helper functions with the `k8s.io/utils/ptr` implementations. ([#132794](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132794), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Replaced `boolPtrFn` helper functions with the "k8s.io/utils/ptr" implementation. ([#132907](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132907), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the apiextensions-apiserver apiextensions. ([#132723](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132723), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the apiserver (1/2). ([#132751](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132751), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the component-base. ([#132754](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132754), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Replaced deprecated package `k8s.io/utils/pointer` with `k8s.io/utils/ptr` for the kube-aggregator apiregistration. ([#132701](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132701), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Simplied validation error message for required fields by removing redundant messages. ([#132472](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132472), [@xiaoweim](https://github.com/xiaoweim)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Cloud Provider, Network, Node and Storage]

- The `KubeletServiceAccountTokenForCredentialProviders` feature was beta and enabled by default. ([#133017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133017), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- The `conditionType` is "oneof" approved/denied check of CertificateSigningRequest's `.status.conditions` field was migrated to declarative validation. 
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate was enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate was enabled, declarative validation was the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#133013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133013), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle))
- The fallback behavior of the Downward API's `resourceFieldRef` field was updated to account for pod-level resources: if container-level limits were not set, pod-level limits were now used before falling back to node allocatable resources. ([#132605](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132605), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus))
- The validation of `replicas` field in the ReplicationController `/scale` subresource has been migrated to declarative validation.
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate is enabled, declarative validation is the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#131664](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131664), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- The validation-gen code generator generated validation code that supported validation ratcheting. ([#132236](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132236), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin))
- Updated `IsDNS1123SubdomainWithUnderscore` so that, when it returned an error, it also returned the correct regex information (`dns1123SubdomainFmtWithUnderscore`). ([#132034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132034), [@ChosenFoam](https://github.com/ChosenFoam))
- Updated etcd version to v3.6.0. ([#131501](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131501), [@joshjms](https://github.com/joshjms))
- Updated the `v1` credential provider configuration to include the `tokenAttributes.cacheType` field. This field is required and must be set to either `ServiceAccount` or `Token` when configuring a provider that uses a service account to fetch registry credentials. ([#132617](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132617), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- Zero-value `metadata.creationTimestamp` values are now omitted and no longer serialize an explicit `null` in JSON, YAML, and CBOR output ([#130989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130989), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- `AppArmor` profiles specified in the Pod or container `SecurityContext` were no longer copied to deprecated `AppArmor` annotations (prefix `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/`). Anything that inspected the deprecated annotations must be migrated to use the `SecurityContext` fields instead. ([#131989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131989), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair))
- `MultiCIDRServiceAllocator` was locked and enabled by default, `DisableAllocatorDualWrite` was enabled by default. ([#131318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131318), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))

### Feature

- Added 3 new metrics for monitoring async API calls in the scheduler when the `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` feature gate was enabled:
    - `scheduler_async_api_call_execution_total`: tracks executed API calls by call type and result (success/error)
    - `scheduler_async_api_call_duration_seconds`: histogram of API call execution duration by call type and result
    - `scheduler_pending_async_api_calls`: gauge showing current number of pending API calls in the queue. ([#133120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133120), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k))
- Added HPA support to pod-level resource specifications. When the pod-level resource feature was enabled, HPAs configured with `Resource` type metrics calculated the pod resources from `pod.Spec.Resources` field, if specified. ([#132430](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132430), [@laoj2](https://github.com/laoj2))
- Added Traffic Distribution field to `kubectl describe service` output ([#131491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131491), [@tchap](https://github.com/tchap)) [SIG CLI]
- Added `SizeBasedListCostEstimate` feature gate that allowed apiserver to estimate sizes of objects to calculate cost of LIST requests. ([#132355](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132355), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Added `apiserver_resource_size_estimate_bytes` metric to API server. ([#132893](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132893), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Added `started_user_namespaced_pods_total` and `started_user_namespaced_pods_errors_total` for tracking the successes and failures in creating pods if a user namespace was requested. ([#132902](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132902), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- Added a `--show-swap` option to `kubectl top` subcommands ([#129458](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129458), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG CLI]
- Added a `container_swap_limit_bytes` metric to expose the swap limit assigned to containers under the `LimitedSwap` swap behavior. ([#132348](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132348), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101))
- Added a delay to node updates after kubelet startup. A random offset, based on the configured `nodeStatusReportFrequency`, helped distribute traffic and load from node status updates more evenly over time. The initial status update could occur up to 50% earlier or later than the regular schedule. ([#130919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130919), [@mengqiy](https://github.com/mengqiy))
- Added a flag to kubectl version to detect whether a client/server version mismatch was outside the officially supported range. ([#127365](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127365), [@omerap12](https://github.com/omerap12))
- Added a new `PreBindPreFlight` function to the `PreBindPlugin` interface. All in-tree `PreBind` plugins have been updated to implement `PreBindPreFlight` function. ([#132391](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132391), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Added a warning when alpha metrics are used with emulated versions. ([#132276](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132276), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Added alpha metrics for compatibility versioning ([#131842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131842), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Added configurable flags to kube-apiserver for coordinated leader election. ([#132433](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132433), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Added machine readable output options (JSON & YAML) to `kubectl api-resources`. ([#132604](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132604), [@dharmit](https://github.com/dharmit))
- Added memory tracking to scheduler performance tests to help detect memory leaks and monitored memory usage patterns while running `scheduler_perf`. ([#132910](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132910), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k))
- Added support for CEL expressions with escaped names in the structured authentication config. Using `[...]` to access claims or user data was recommended when names contained characters that would otherwise need escaping. CEL optionals with `?` could be used where has was not applicable — for example, `claims[?"kubernetes.io"]` or `user.extra[?"domain.io/foo"]`. ([#131574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131574), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))
- Added support for `--cpu`, `--memory` flag to `kubectl autoscale`, started deprecating `--cpu-precent`. ([#129373](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129373), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025))
- Added support for a new kubectl output format, `kyaml`. KYAML was a strict subset of YAML and should be accepted by any YAML processor. The formatting of KYAML was halfway between JSON and YAML.  Because it was more explicit than the default YAML style, it was less error-prone. ([#132942](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132942), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Added the `DetectCacheInconsistency` feature gate, allowing the API server to periodically verify consistency between its `cache` and `etcd`. Detected inconsistencies reported via the `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total` metric and trigger purging of affected cache snapshots. ([#132884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132884), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Added the `SizeBasedListCostEstimate` feature gate (enabled by default), which changes how APF seats are assigned to `LIST` requests. With this feature, one seat is assigned per 100KB of data loaded into memory at once during a `LIST` operation. ([#132932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132932), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))

- Bumped `KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI` to GA and add metric to track out-of-support CRI implementations. ([#133157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133157), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))
- CRI API had auth fields in image pulling marked as `debug_redact`. ([#133135](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133135), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- Changed handling of `CustomResourceDefinitions` with unrecognized formats. Writing a schema with an unrecognized format now triggered a warning (the write was still accepted). ([#133136](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133136), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin))
- DRA kubelet: Fixed the kubelet to also clean up `ResourceSlices` in some additional failure scenarios (driver was removed forcibly or crashed and did not restart). ([#132058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132058), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- DRAAdminAccess was enabled by default allowing users to create `ResourceClaims` and `ResourceClaimTemplates` in privileged mode to grant access to devices that were in use by other users for admin tasks like monitoring health or status of the device. ([#133085](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133085), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh))
- Demoted KEP-5278 feature gates `ClearingNominatedNodeNameAfterBinding` and `NominatedNodeNameForExpectation` to alpha from beta. ([#133293](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133293), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k))
- Deprecated `apiserver_storage_objects` and replaced it with `apiserver_resource_objects` metric using labels consistent with other metrics. ([#132965](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132965), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Eliminated work when creating Services or understanding port purposes, especially for external resources deployed via Helm charts. ([#133018](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133018), [@rushmash91](https://github.com/rushmash91))

- Enabled completion for aliases defined in `kubectlrc`. ([#131586](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131586), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Enabled the PreferSameTrafficDistribution feature gate by default,
  enabling the `PreferSameNode` traffic distribution value for Services. ([#132127](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132127), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))
- Ensured memory resizing for Guaranteed QoS pods on static Memory policy configurations was gated by `InPlacePodVerticalScalingExclusiveMemory` (defaults: `false`). ([#132473](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132473), [@pravk03](https://github.com/pravk03))
- Ensured that non-scheduling related errors (e.g., network errors) did not lengthen the Pod scheduling backoff time. ([#128748](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128748), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Executed API calls dispatched during pod scheduling asynchronously if the `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` feature gate was enabled.
  Out-of-tree plugins used `APIDispatcher` and `APICacher` from the framework to dispatch their own calls. ([#132886](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132886), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko))
- Fixed recording the `kubelet_container_resize_requests_total` metric to include all resize-related updates. ([#133060](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133060), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575))
- Graduated `ListFromCacheSnapshot` to beta. ([#132901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132901), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated `PodLevelResources` feature to beta and have it on by default. This feature allowed defining CPU and memory resources for an entire pod in `pod.spec.resources`. ([#132999](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132999), [@ndixita](https://github.com/ndixita))
- Graduated `PodObservedGenerationTracking` feature to beta and had it on by default. This feature meant that the top level `status.observedGeneration` and `status.conditions[].observedGeneration` fields in Pods were populated to reflect the `metadata.generation` of the podspec at the time that the status or condition was reported. ([#132912](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132912), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575))
- Graduated `ResilientWatchCacheInitialization` to GA. ([#131979](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131979), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated `StreamingCollectionEncodingToJSON` and `StreamingCollectionEncodingToProtobuf` to GA. ([#132648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132648), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))

- Graduated relaxed DNS search string validation to GA. For the Pod API, `.spec.dnsConfig.searches`
  now allows an underscore (`_`) where a dash (`-`) would be allowed, and it allows search strings be a single dot `.`. ([#132036](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132036), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Graduated scheduler `QueueingHint` support to GA (general availability) ([#131973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131973), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated the WinOverlay feature in the kube-proxy to GA. The **WinOverlay** feature gate was enabled by default. ([#133042](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133042), [@rzlink](https://github.com/rzlink))
- Graduated the `ConsistentListFromCache` to GA. ([#132645](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132645), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated the `WatchList` feature gate to beta for kube-apiserver and enabled `WatchListClient` for KCM. ([#132704](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132704), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial))
- Graduated the `WinDSR` feature in the kube-proxy to GA. The `WinDSR` feature gate was enabled by default. ([#132108](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132108), [@rzlink](https://github.com/rzlink))
- If `PreBindPreFlight` returned `Skip`, the scheduler didn't run the plugin at `PreBind`.
  If any `PreBindPreFlight` returned `Success`, the scheduler put NominatedNodeName to the pod 
  so that other components (such as the cluster autoscaler) could notice the pod was going to be bound to the node. ([#133021](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133021), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))
- Implemented prioritization of resize requests based on `priorityClass` and QoS class when node resources are insufficient to accommodate all pending resize operations. ([#132342](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132342), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575))
- Included the namespace in the output of `kubectl delete` for better identification of resources. ([#126619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126619), [@totegamma](https://github.com/totegamma))
- Increased APF max seats to 100 for LIST requests. ([#133034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133034), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Introduced a method `GetPCIeRootAttributeByPCIBusID(pciBusID)` for third-party DRA drivers to provide common logic for the standardized device attribute `resource.kubernetes.io/pcieRoot`. ([#132296](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132296), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace))
- Kube-apiserver reported the last configuration hash as a label in
  
  - `apiserver_authentication_config_controller_last_config_info` metric after successfully loading the authentication configuration file.
  - `apiserver_authorization_config_controller_last_config_info` metric after successfully loading the authorization configuration file.
  - `apiserver_encryption_config_controller_last_config_info` metric after successfully loading the encryption configuration file. ([#132299](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132299), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- Kube-apiserver: Each unique set of etcd server overrides specified with `--etcd-servers-overrides` surfaced health checks named `etcd-override-<index>` and `etcd-override-readiness-<index>`. These checks were still excluded by the `?exclude=etcd` and `?exclude=etcd-readiness` directives. ([#129438](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129438), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Kube-apiserver: Previously persisted `CustomResourceDefinition` objects with an invalid whitespace-only `caBundle` could serve requests that did not require conversion. ([#132514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132514), [@tiffanny29631](https://github.com/tiffanny29631))
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature to beta, which enabled external signing of service account tokens and fetching of public verifying keys. This was accomplished by enabling the beta `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature gate and specifying the `--service-account-signing-endpoint` flag. The flag value could either be the path to a Unix domain socket on the filesystem, or be prefixed with @ to indicate a Unix domain socket in the abstract namespace. ([#131300](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131300), [@HarshalNeelkamal](https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal))
- Kube-proxy: Checked whether IPv6 was available on Linux before using it. ([#131265](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131265), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz))
- Kubeadm: Added support for ECDSA-P384 as an encryption algorithm type in v1beta4. ([#131677](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131677), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375))

- Kubeadm: graduated the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate to beta and enabed it by default. When its enabled, kubeadm will:
    1. Generate a `/var/lib/kubelet/instance-config.yaml` file to customize the `containerRuntimeEndpoint` field in per-node kubelet configurations.
    2. Remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from nodes during upgrade operations.
    3. Remove the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file during upgrades. ([#131981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131981), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: graduated the kubeadm specific feature gate `WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents` to GA. The feature gate is was locked to always be enabled and on node initialization kubeadm performed a health check for all control plane components and not only the `kube-apiserver`. ([#132594](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132594), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: switched the validation check for Linux kernel version to throw warnings instead of errors. ([#131919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131919), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- Kubelet detected terminal CSI volume mount failures due to exceeded attachment limits on the node and marked the Stateful Pod as Failed, allowing its controller to recreate it. This prevented Pods from getting stuck indefinitely in the `ContainerCreating` state. ([#132933](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132933), [@torredil](https://github.com/torredil))
- Kubelet reported a hash of the credential provider configuration via the `kubelet_credential_provider_config_info` metric. The hash was exposed in the `hash` label. ([#133016](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133016), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase))
- Kubelet: Extended the `--image-credential-provider-config` flag to accept a directory path in addition to a single file. When a directory was specified, all .json, .yaml, and .yml files in that directory were loaded and merged in lexicographical order. ([#131658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131658), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- LeaseLocks could now have custom labels that different holders would overwrite when they became the holder of the underlying lease. ([#131632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131632), [@DerekFrank](https://github.com/DerekFrank))
- Memory limits could be decreased with a `NotRequired` resize restart policy. When decreasing memory limits,a best-effort check was performed to prevent limits from decreasing below usage and triggering an OOM-kill. ([#133012](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133012), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair))
- Migrated validation in `CertificateSigningRequest` to use declarative validation. When the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics. If `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` is enabled, declarative validation becomes the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#132361](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132361), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin))
- Moved Recover from volume expansion failure to GA. ([#132662](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132662), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
- Prevented any type of CPU/Memory alignment or hint generation with the Topology Manager from the CPU or Memory Manager when pod-level resources were used in the Pod spec. ([#133279](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133279), [@ffromani](https://github.com/ffromani))

- Promoted the `KubeletPodResourcesDynamicResources` and `KubeletPodResourcesGet` feature gates to beta, which were enabled by default if DRA went to GA. ([#132940](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132940), [@guptaNswati](https://github.com/guptaNswati))
- Promoted the feature `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` to GA. ([#131514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131514), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37))
- Removed "endpoint-controller" and "workload-leader-election" FlowSchemas from the default APF configuration.
  
  migrate the lock type used in the leader election in your workloads from configmapsleases/endpointsleases to leases. ([#131215](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131215), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network, Scalability and Scheduling]
- Started recording metrics for in-place Pod resize. ([#132903](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132903), [@natasha41575](https://github.com/natasha41575))
- The Kubernetes API server merged selectors built from `matchLabelKeys` into the `labelSelector` of `topologySpreadConstraints`, aligning Pod Topology Spread behavior with Inter-Pod Affinity. To prevent breaking existing Pods using `matchLabelKeys`, this scheduler behavior was preserved until v1.34. Upgrades from v1.32 to v1.34 should be done incrementally (v1.32 → v1.33 → v1.34), ensuring Pods created at v1.32 with `matchLabelKeys` are scheduled before reaching v1.34. Controllers relying on `matchLabelKeys` no longer need to handle them directly and can use `labelSelector` instead. The new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge`, enabled by default, controls this behavior. ([#129874](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129874), [@mochizuki875](https://github.com/mochizuki875))
- The new `dra_resource_claims_in_use` kubelet metrics reported active `ResourceClaims`, overall and by driver. ([#131641](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131641), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- The scheduler no longer cleared the `nominatedNodeName` field for Pods. External components, such as Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter, were responsible for managing this field when needed. ([#133276](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133276), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko))
- The validation in the CertificateSigningRequest `/status` and `/approval` subresources was migrated to declarative validation.
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate was enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate was enabled, declarative validation was the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#133068](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133068), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin))
- Updated `kube-controller-manager` events to support contextual logging. ([#128351](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128351), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu))
- Updated pause version to `registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10.1`. ([#130713](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130713), [@ArkaSaha30](https://github.com/ArkaSaha30))
- Updated the Kubernetes build environment to use Go `1.24.5`. ([#132896](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132896), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato))

- When proxying to an aggregated API server, kube-apiserver used the
  `EndpointSlices` of the `service` indicated by the `APIServer`, rather than
  using Endpoints.
  
  If you were using the aggregated API server feature, and you were writing out
  the endpoints for it by hand (rather than letting kube-controller-manager
  generate `Endpoints` and `EndpointSlices` for it automatically based on the
  Service definition), then you should write out an EndpointSlice object rather
  than (or in addition to) an `Endpoints` object. ([#129837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129837), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))
- Whenever a pod was successfully bound to a node, the kube-apiserver  cleared the pod's `nominatedNodeName` field. This prevented stale information from affecting external scheduling components. ([#132443](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132443), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k))
- `DRAPrioritizedList` was turned on by default which made it possible to provide a prioritized list of subrequests in a `ResourceClaim`. ([#132767](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132767), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent))
- `PodLifecycleSleepAction` was graduated to GA. ([#132595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132595), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan))
- `kube-controller-manager` reported the following metrics for `ResourceClaims` with admin access:
  - `resourceclaim_controller_creates_total` count metric with labels `admin_access` (true or false), `status` (failure or success) to track the total number of `ResourceClaims` creation requests
  - `resourceclaim_controller_resource_claims` gauge metric with labels `admin_access` (true or false), `allocated` (true or false) to track the current number of `ResourceClaims`. ([#132800](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132800), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh))
- `kubeadm`: Started using a named port `probe-port` for all probes in the static pod manifests generated by `kubeadm` for the `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, `kube-scheduler`, and related components. If probe port values were previously patched using `kubeadm` patches, the corresponding named port under the container’s `ports` field must now also be patched. ([#132776](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132776), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))

### Failing Test

- DRA driver helper: Fixed handling of apiserver restart when running on a Kubernetes version which did not support the `resource.k8s.io` version used by the DRA driver. ([#133076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133076), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Fixed e2e test "[Driver: csi-hostpath] [Testpattern: Dynamic PV (filesystem volmode)] volumeLimits should support volume limits" not to leak Pods and namespaces. ([#132674](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132674), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))

([#131495](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131495), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Modified the node-local `podresources` API endpoint to consider only active pods. Since this changes long-standing behavior, the `KubeletPodResourcesListUseActivePods` feature gate (enabled by default) can be disabled to restore the previous behavior. Users encountering regressions are encouraged to file an issue if they rely on the old behavior. ([#132028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132028), [@ffromani](https://github.com/ffromani))

([#132121](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132121), [@atiratree](https://github.com/atiratree))
- Resolved a bug where DaemonSet updates unnecessarily triggered duplicate validation due to overlapping calls to `ValidateDaemonSet` and ValidateDaemonSetUpdate.

- Updated the HPA controller so that it no longer emitted a `FailedRescale` event if a scale operation initially failed due to a conflict but succeeded after a retry; it now emitted a `SuccessfulRescale` event in this case. A `FailedRescale` event was still emitted if all retries were exhausted. ([#132007](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132007), [@AumPatel1](https://github.com/AumPatel1))
- `Statefulset` respected `minReadySeconds`. ([#130909](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130909), [@Edwinhr716](https://github.com/Edwinhr716))
