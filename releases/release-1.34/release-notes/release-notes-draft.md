## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- For metrics `apiserver_cache_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_cache_list_total` replace `resource_prefix` label with API `group` and `resource` labels.
  For metrics `etcd_request_duration_seconds`, `etcd_requests_total` and `etcd_request_errors_total` replace `type` label with API `resource` and `group` label.
  For metric `apiserver_selfrequest_total` add a API `group` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_watch_events_sizes` and `apiserver_watch_events_total` replace API `kind` label with `resource` label.
  For metrics `apiserver_request_body_size_bytes`, `apiserver_storage_events_received_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_evaluated_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_fetched_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_returned_objects_total`, `apiserver_storage_list_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_dispatched_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_events_received_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_initializations_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_resource_version`, `watch_cache_capacity`, `apiserver_init_events_total`, `apiserver_terminated_watchers_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_increase_total`, `watch_cache_capacity_decrease_total`, `apiserver_watch_cache_read_wait_seconds`, `apiserver_watch_cache_consistent_read_total`, `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total`, `etcd_bookmark_counts`, `storage_decode_errors_total` extract the API group from `resource` label and put it in new `group` label. ([#131845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131845), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd, Instrumentation and Testing]
 - Kubelet:  removed the deprecated flag `--cloud-config` from the command line. ([#130161](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130161), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Node and Scalability]
 - Scheduling Framework exposes NodeInfos to the PreFilterPlugins.
  The PreFilterPlugins need to accept the NodeInfo list from the arguments. ([#130720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130720), [@saintube](https://github.com/saintube)) [SIG Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
 - Static pods that reference API objects are now denied admission by the kubelet so that static pods would not be silently running even after the mirror pod creation fails.
  Prior to upgrade, ensure static pods are not referencing API objects such as ServiceAccounts, ConfigMaps, Secrets, ResourceClaims, CSIDrivers, PersistentVolumeClaims, or ClusterTrustBundles. ([#131837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131837), [@sreeram-venkitesh](https://github.com/sreeram-venkitesh)) [SIG Auth, Node and Testing]

- DRA kubelet: gRPC API graduated to v1, v1beta1 is deprecated starting in 1.34. Updating DRA drivers to the k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/kubeletplugin helper from 1.34 adds support for both API versions. ([#132700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132700), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node and Testing]

  --> ([#131996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131996), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Add a `runtime.ApplyConfiguration` interface that is implemented by all generated applyconfigs ([#132194](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132194), [@alvaroaleman](https://github.com/alvaroaleman)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Add a new `FileKeyRef` field to containers, allowing them to load variables from files by setting this field.
  
  Introduce the EnvFiles feature gate to govern activation of this functionality. ([#132626](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132626), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- Add driver-owned fields in ResourceSlice to mark whether the device is shareable among multiple resource claims (or requests) and to specify how each capacity can be shared between different requests.
  - Add user-owned fields in ResourceClaim to specify resource requirements against each device capacity.
  - Add scheduler-owned field in ResourceClaim.Status to specify how much device capacity is reserved for a specific request.
  - Add an additional identifier to ResourceClaim.Status for the device supports multiple allocations.
  - Add a new constraint type to enforce uniqueness of specified attributes across all allocated devices. ([#132522](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132522), [@sunya-ch](https://github.com/sunya-ch)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Add new optional APIs in ResouceSlice.Basic and ResourceClaim.Status.AllocatedDeviceStatus. ([#130160](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130160), [@KobayashiD27](https://github.com/KobayashiD27)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Added `tokenAttributes.cacheType` field to v1 credential provider config. This field is required to be set to either ServiceAccount or Token when configuring a provider that uses service account to fetch registry credentials. ([#132617](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132617), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth, Node and Testing]
- Added a mechanism for configurable container restarts: _container level restart rules_. This is an alpha feature behind the `ContainerRestartRules` feature gate. ([#132642](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132642), [@yuanwang04](https://github.com/yuanwang04)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- Added detailed event for in-place pod vertical scaling completed, improving cluster management and debugging ([#130387](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130387), [@shiya0705](https://github.com/shiya0705)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Autoscaling, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Added omitempty and opt tag to the API v1beta2 AdminAccess type in the DeviceRequestAllocationResult struct. ([#132338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132338), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs)) [SIG Auth]
- Added validation to reject Pods using the `PodLevelResources` feature on Windows OS due to lack of support. The API server rejects Pods with Pod-level resources and a `Pod.spec.os.name` targeting Windows. Kubelet on nodes running Windows also rejects Pods with Pod-level resources at admission phase. ([#133046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133046), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Adds warnings when creating headless service with set loadBalancerIP,externalIPs and/or SessionAffinity ([#132214](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132214), [@Peac36](https://github.com/Peac36)) [SIG Network]

- Allows setting the `hostnameOverride` field in `PodSpec` to specify any RFC 1123 DNS subdomain as the pod's hostname. The `HostnameOverride` feature gate has been introduced to control enablement of this functionality. ([#132558](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132558), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network, Node and Testing]
- AppArmor profiles specified in the pod or container SecurityContext are no longer copied to deprecated AppArmor annotations (prefix `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/`). Anything that inspects the deprecated annotations must be migrated to use the SecurityContext fields instead. ([#131989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131989), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG Node]
- Changes underlying logic to propagate Pod level hugepage cgroup to containers when they do not specify hugepage resources.
  - Adds validation to enforce the hugepage aggregated container limits to be smaller or equal to pod-level limits. This was already enforced with the defaulted requests from the specified limits, however it did not make it clear about both hugepage requests and limits. ([#131089](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131089), [@KevinTMtz](https://github.com/KevinTMtz)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- DRA API: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3 now only contains DeviceTaintRule. All other types got removed because they became obsolete when introducing the v1beta1 API in 1.32.
  before updating a cluster where resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, deviceclasses, or resourceslices might have been stored using Kubernetes < 1.32, delete all of those resources before updating and recreate them as needed while running Kubernetes >= 1.32. ([#132000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132000), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: the scheduler plugin now prevents abnormal filter runtimes by timing out after 10 seconds. This is configurable via the plugin configuration's `FilterTimeout`. Setting it to zero disables the timeout and restores the behavior of Kubernetes <= 1.33. ([#132033](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132033), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: the v1alpha4 kubelet gRPC API (added in 1.31, superseded in 1.32) is no longer supported. DRA drivers using the helper package from Kubernetes  >= 1.32 use the v1beta1 API and continue to be supported. ([#132574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132574), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node]
- DRA: when the prioritized list feature is used in a request and the resulting number of allocated devices exceeds the number of allowed devices per claim, the scheduler aborts the attempt to allocate devices early. Previously it tried to many different combinations, which can take a long time. ([#130593](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130593), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Deprecate StreamingConnectionIdleTimeout field of the kubelet config. ([#131992](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131992), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375)) [SIG Node]
- Dynamic Resource Allocation: graduated core functionality to general availability (GA). This newly stable feature uses the _structured parameters_ flavor of DRA. ([#132706](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132706), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Autoscaling, Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Enable kube-apiserver support for PodCertificateRequest and PodCertificate projected volumes (behind the PodCertificateRequest feature gate). ([#128010](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128010), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Cloud Provider, Etcd, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Extended resources backed by DRA feature allows cluster operator to specify extendedResourceName in DeviceClass, and application operator to continue using extended resources in pod's requests to request for DRA devices matching the DeviceClass.
  
  NodeResourcesFit plugin scoring won't work for extended resources backed by DRA ([#130653](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130653), [@yliaog](https://github.com/yliaog)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Extends the nodeports scheduling plugin to consider hostPorts used by restartable init containers. ([#132040](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132040), [@avrittrohwer](https://github.com/avrittrohwer)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Fix prerelease lifecycle  for PodCertificateRequest ([#133350](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133350), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixes a 1.33 regression that can cause a nil panic in kube-scheduler when aggregating resource requests across container's spec and status. ([#132895](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132895), [@yue9944882](https://github.com/yue9944882)) [SIG Node and Scheduling]
- Introduced OpenAPI format support for `k8s-short-name` and `k8s-long-name` in CustomResourceDefinition schemas. ([#132504](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132504), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Introduced the admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/MutatingAdmissionPolicy API type.
  To enable, enable the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate (which is off by default) and set `--runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=true` on the kube-apiserver. 
  Note that the default stored version remains alpha in 1.34 and whoever enabled beta during 1.34 needs to run a storage migration yourself to ensure you don't depend on alpha data in etcd. ([#132821](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132821), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd and Testing]
- JWT authenticators specified via the `AuthenticationConfiguration.jwt` array can now optionally specify either the `controlplane` or `cluster` egress selector by setting the `issuer.egressSelectorType` field.  When unset, the prior behavior of using no egress selector is retained.  The StructuredAuthenticationConfigurationEgressSelector beta feature (default on) must be enabled to use this functionality. ([#132768](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132768), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Caching of authorization webhook decisions for authorized and unauthorized requests can now be disabled in the `--authorization-config` file by setting the new fields `cacheAuthorizedRequests` or `cacheUnauthorizedRequests` to `false` explicitly. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#using-configuration-file-for-authorization for more details. ([#129237](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129237), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]

- Kube-apiserver: the AuthenticationConfiguration type accepted in `--authentication-config` files has been promoted to `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1`. ([#131752](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131752), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-log-runner: rotating log output into a new file when reaching a certain file size can be requested via the new `-log-file-size` parameter. `-log-file-age` enables automatical removal of old output files.  Periodic flushing can be requested through ` -flush-interval`. ([#127667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127667), [@zylxjtu](https://github.com/zylxjtu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]
- Kubectl: graduated `kuberc` support to beta. A `kuberc` configuration file provides a mechanism for customizing kubectl behavior (separate from kubeconfig, which configured cluster access across different clients). ([#131818](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131818), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- MultiCIDRServiceAllocator is locked and enabled by default, DisableAllocatorDualWrite is enabled by default ([#131318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131318), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Network and Testing]

- The Kubelet can now monitor the health of devices allocated via Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) and report it in the `pod.status.containerStatuses.allocatedResourcesStatus` field. This requires the DRA plugin to implement the new v1alpha1 `NodeHealth` gRPC service. This feature is controlled by the `ResourceHealthStatus` feature gate. ([#130606](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130606), [@Jpsassine](https://github.com/Jpsassine)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]

- The conditionType is "oneof" approved/denied check of CertificateSigningRequest's `.status.conditions` field has been migrated to declarative validation. 
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate is enabled, declarative validation is the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#133013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133013), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- The fallback behavior of the Downward API's `resourceFieldRef` field has been updated to account for pod-level resources: if container-level limits are not set, pod-level limits are now used before falling back to node allocatable resources. ([#132605](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132605), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- The kubelet's image pull credential tracking now supports service account-based verification. When an image is pulled using service account credentials via external credential providers, subsequent pods using the same service account (UID, name, and namespace) can access the cached image without re-authentication for the lifetime of that service account. ([#132771](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132771), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth, Node and Testing]
- The validation of `replicas` field in the ReplicationController `/scale` subresource has been migrated to declarative validation.
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.

- The validation-gen code generator generates validation code that supports validation ratcheting. ([#132236](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132236), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Node]
- This PR corrects that documentation, making it clear to users that podSelector is optional and describes its default behavior. ([#131354](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131354), [@tomoish](https://github.com/tomoish)) [SIG Network]
- Update etcd version to v3.6.0 ([#131501](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131501), [@joshjms](https://github.com/joshjms)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd and Testing]
- When the IsDNS1123SubdomainWithUnderscore function returns an error, it will return the correct regex information dns1123SubdomainFmtWithUnderscore. ([#132034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132034), [@ChosenFoam](https://github.com/ChosenFoam)) [SIG Network]
- Zero-value `metadata.creationTimestamp` values are now omitted and no longer serialize an explicit `null` in JSON, YAML, and CBOR output ([#130989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130989), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]

### Feature

- API calls dispatched during pod scheduling are now executed asynchronously if the SchedulerAsyncAPICalls feature gate is enabled.
  Out-of-tree plugins can use APIDispatcher and APICacher from the framework to dispatch their own calls. ([#132886](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132886), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Add DetectCacheInconsistency feature gate that allows apiserver to periodically compare consistency between cache and etcd. Inconsistency is reported to `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total` metric and results in cache snapshots being purged. ([#132884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132884), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Instrumentation and Testing]

    1. Generate a `/var/lib/kubelet/instance-config.yaml` file to customize the `containerRuntimeEndpoint` field in per-node kubelet configurations.
    2. Remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from nodes during upgrade operations.
    3. Remove the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file during upgrades. ([#131981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131981), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- Kubernetes api-server now merges selectors built from matchLabelKeys into the labelSelector of topologySpreadConstraints, 
  aligning Pod Topology Spread with the approach used by Inter-Pod Affinity.
  
  To avoid breaking existing pods that use matchLabelKeys, the current scheduler behavior will be preserved until it is removed in v1.34. 
  Therefore, do not upgrade your scheduler directly from v1.32 to v1.34. 
  Instead, upgrade step-by-step (from v1.32 to v1.33, then to v1.34), 
  ensuring that any pods created at v1.32 with matchLabelKeys are either removed or already scheduled by the time you reach v1.34.
  
  If you maintain controllers that previously relied on matchLabelKeys (for instance, to simulate scheduling), 
  you likely no longer need to handle matchLabelKeys directly. Instead, you can just rely on the labelSelector field going forward.
  
  Additionally, a new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge`, which is enabled by default, has been 
  added to control this behavior. ([#129874](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129874), [@mochizuki875](https://github.com/mochizuki875)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]

- When proxying to an aggregated API server, kube-apiserver now uses the
  EndpointSlices of the `service` indicated by the `APIServer`, rather than

  If you are using the aggregated API server feature, and you are writing out
  the endpoints for it by hand (rather than letting kube-controller-manager
  generate Endpoints and EndpointSlices for it automatically based on the
  Service definition), then you should write out an EndpointSlice object rather
  than (or in addition to) an Endpoints object. ([#129837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129837), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Network and Testing]
