### API Change

- Added a `runtime.ApplyConfiguration` interface implemented by all generated apply configuration types. ([#132194](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132194), [@alvaroaleman](https://github.com/alvaroaleman)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Added omitempty and opt tag to the API `v1beta2` AdminAccess type in the `DeviceRequestAllocationResult` struct. ([#132338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132338), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Corrected the documentation to clarify that `podSelector` is optional and to describe its default behavior. ([#131354](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131354), [@tomoish](https://github.com/tomoish))
- DRA API: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3 now only contains DeviceTaintRule. All other types got removed because they became obsolete when introducing the v1beta1 API in 1.32.
  before updating a cluster where resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, deviceclasses, or resourceslices might have been stored using Kubernetes < 1.32, delete all of those resources before updating and recreate them as needed while running Kubernetes >= 1.32. ([#132000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132000), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, the alpha-level `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` label has been updated to `resource.kubernetes.io/admin-access`. Admins using the alpha feature and updating from 1.33 can set both labels, upgrade, then remove `resource.k8s.io/admin-access` when no downgrade is going to happen anymore. ([#131996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131996), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Extended the NodePorts scheduling plugin to consider hostPorts used by restartable init containers. ([#132040](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132040), [@avrittrohwer](https://github.com/avrittrohwer)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Introduced OpenAPI format support for `k8s-short-name` and `k8s-long-name` in `CustomResourceDefinition` schemas. ([#132504](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132504), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Kube-apiserver: Added support for disabling caching of authorization webhook decisions in the `--authorization-config` file. The new fields `cacheAuthorizedRequests` and `cacheUnauthorizedRequests` could be set to `false` to prevent caching for authorized or unauthorized requests. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#using-configuration-file-for-authorization for more details. ([#129237](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129237), [@rfranzke](https://github.com/rfranzke)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `StructuredAuthenticationConfiguration` feature gate to GA. ([#131916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131916), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: the AuthenticationConfiguration type accepted in `--authentication-config` files has been promoted to `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1`. ([#131752](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131752), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-log-runner: Added the `-log-file-size` parameter to rotate log output into a new file once it reached a certain size. Introduced `-log-file-age` to enable automatic removal of old output files, and `-flush-interval` to support periodic flushing. ([#127667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127667), [@zylxjtu](https://github.com/zylxjtu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]
- Kubectl: Graduated `kuberc` support to beta. A `kuberc` configuration file provided a mechanism for customizing `kubectl` behavior (distinct from kubeconfig, which configures cluster access across different clients). ([#131818](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131818), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Promoted Job Pod Replacement Policy to general availability. The `JobPodReplacementPolicy` feature gate is now locked to true, and will be removed in a future release of Kubernetes. ([#132173](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132173), [@dejanzele](https://github.com/dejanzele)) [SIG Apps and Testing]
- Promoted the `RelaxedEnvironmentVariableValidation` feature gate to GA and locked it in the enabled state by default. ([#132054](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132054), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Removed an inaccurate statement about requiring ports when the Pod spec `hostNetwork` field was set. ([#130994](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130994), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG Network and Node]
- TBD ([#131318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131318), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Network and Testing]
- The validation of `replicas` field in the ReplicationController `/scale` subresource has been migrated to declarative validation.
  If the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  If the `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate is enabled, declarative validation is the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#131664](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131664), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- The validation-gen code generator generated validation code that supported validation ratcheting. ([#132236](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132236), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Node]
- Updated `IsDNS1123SubdomainWithUnderscore` so that, when it returned an error, it also returned the correct regex information (`dns1123SubdomainFmtWithUnderscore`). ([#132034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132034), [@ChosenFoam](https://github.com/ChosenFoam))
- Updated etcd version to v3.6.0. ([#131501](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131501), [@joshjms](https://github.com/joshjms)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd and Testing]
- Zero-value `metadata.creationTimestamp` values are now omitted and no longer serialize an explicit `null` in JSON, YAML, and CBOR output ([#130989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130989), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]

### Feature

- Added Traffic Distribution field to `kubectl describe service` output ([#131491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131491), [@tchap](https://github.com/tchap)) [SIG CLI]
- Added a `--show-swap` option to `kubectl top` subcommands ([#129458](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129458), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG CLI]
- Added a delay to node updates after kubelet startup. A random offset, based on the configured `nodeStatusReportFrequency`, helps spread the traffic and load (due to node status updates) more evenly over time. The initial status update can be up to 50% earlier or 50% later than the regular schedule. ([#130919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130919), [@mengqiy](https://github.com/mengqiy)) [SIG Node]
- Added a flag to kubectl version to detect whether a client/server version mismatch was outside the officially supported range. ([#127365](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127365), [@omerap12](https://github.com/omerap12))
- Added alpha metrics for compatibility versioning ([#131842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131842), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Added support for CEL expressions with escaped names in the structured authentication config. Using `[...]` to access claims or user data was recommended when names contained characters that would otherwise need escaping. CEL optionals with `?` could be used where has was not applicable — for example, `claims[?"kubernetes.io"]` or `user.extra[?"domain.io/foo"]`. ([#131574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131574), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Built Kubernetes using Go 1.24.3. ([#131934](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131934), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Built Kubernetes using Go 1.24.4. ([#132222](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132222), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Enabled completion for aliases defined in `kubectlrc`. ([#131586](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131586), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Ensured that non-scheduling related errors (e.g., network errors) did not lengthen the Pod scheduling backoff time. ([#128748](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128748), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated `ResilientWatchCacheInitialization` to GA. ([#131979](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131979), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated configurable endpoints for anonymous authentication using the authentication configuration file to stable. ([#131654](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131654), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Graduated relaxed DNS search string validation to GA. For the Pod API, `.spec.dnsConfig.searches`
  now allows an underscore (`_`) where a dash (`-`) would be allowed, and it allows search strings be a single dot `.`. ([#132036](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132036), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Graduated scheduler `QueueingHint` support to GA (general availability) ([#131973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131973), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Included namespace in the output of the kubectl delete for clearer identification of resources. ([#126619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126619), [@totegamma](https://github.com/totegamma)) [SIG CLI]
- Kube-apiserver: Each unique set of etcd server overrides specified with `--etcd-servers-overrides` now surfaced health checks named `etcd-override-<index>` and `etcd-override-readiness-<index>`. These checks were still excluded by the `?exclude=etcd` and `?exclude=etcd-readiness` directives. ([#129438](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129438), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature to beta, which enabled external signing of service account tokens and fetching of public verifying keys. This was accomplished by enabling the beta `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature gate and specifying the `--service-account-signing-endpoint` flag. The flag value could either be the path to a Unix domain socket on the filesystem, or be prefixed with @ to indicate a Unix domain socket in the abstract namespace. ([#131300](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131300), [@HarshalNeelkamal](https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-proxy: Checked whether IPv6 was available on Linux before using it. ([#131265](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131265), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz))
- Kubeadm: Added support for ECDSA-P384 as an encryption algorithm type in v1beta4. ([#131677](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131677), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375))
- Kubeadm: Fixed an issue where etcd member promotion failed with an error indicating the member was already promoted. ([#130782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130782), [@BernardMC](https://github.com/BernardMC))
- Kubeadm: graduated the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate to beta and enabed it by default. When its enabled, kubeadm will:
    1. Generate a `/var/lib/kubelet/instance-config.yaml` file to customize the `containerRuntimeEndpoint` field in per-node kubelet configurations.
    2. Remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from nodes during upgrade operations.
    3. Remove the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file during upgrades. ([#131981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131981), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: switched the validation check for Linux kernel version to throw warnings instead of errors. ([#131919](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131919), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- Kubelet: Extended the `--image-credential-provider-config` flag to accept a directory path in addition to a single file. When a directory was specified, all .json, .yaml, and .yml files in that directory were loaded and merged in lexicographical order. ([#131658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131658), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- LeaseLocks could now have custom labels that different holders would overwrite when they became the holder of the underlying lease. ([#131632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131632), [@DerekFrank](https://github.com/DerekFrank))
- Promoted the feature `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` to GA. ([#131514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131514), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Removed "endpoint-controller" and "workload-leader-election" FlowSchemas from the default APF configuration.
  
  migrate the lock type used in the leader election in your workloads from configmapsleases/endpointsleases to leases. ([#131215](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131215), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network, Scalability and Scheduling]
- The Kubernetes API server merged selectors built from `matchLabelKeys` into the `labelSelector` of `topologySpreadConstraints`, aligning Pod Topology Spread behavior with Inter-Pod Affinity. To prevent breaking existing Pods using `matchLabelKeys`, this scheduler behavior was preserved until v1.34. Upgrades from v1.32 to v1.34 should be done incrementally (v1.32 → v1.33 → v1.34), ensuring Pods created at v1.32 with `matchLabelKeys` are scheduled before reaching v1.34. Controllers relying on `matchLabelKeys` no longer need to handle them directly and can use `labelSelector` instead. The new feature gate `MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpreadSelectorMerge`, enabled by default, controls this behavior. ([#129874](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129874), [@mochizuki875](https://github.com/mochizuki875)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- The PreferSameTrafficDistribution feature gate is now enabled by default,
  enabling the `PreferSameNode` traffic distribution value for Services. ([#132127](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132127), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Updated `kube-controller-manager` events to support contextual logging. ([#128351](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128351), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu))
- Updated the built in `system:monitoring` role with permission to access kubelet metrics endpoints. ([#132178](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132178), [@gavinkflam](https://github.com/gavinkflam)) [SIG Auth]

### Failing Test

- Kube-apiserver: The --service-account-signing-endpoint flag now only validates the format of abstract socket names ([#131509](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131509), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]

- Kube-apiserver: Defaulted empty `spec.jobTemplate.spec.podFailurePolicy.rules[*].onPodConditions[*].status` fields for CronJob objects as documented, avoiding validation failures during write requests. ([#131525](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131525), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kube-apiserver: Fixed OIDC discovery document publishing when external service account token signing was enabled. ([#131493](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131493), [@hoskeri](https://github.com/hoskeri)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-proxy: Removed the iptables CLI wait interval flag. ([#131961](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131961), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder))
- Kube-scheduler: in Kubernetes 1.33, the number of devices that can be allocated per ResourceClaim was accidentally reduced to 16. Now the supported number of devices per ResourceClaim is 32 again. ([#131662](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131662), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent)) [SIG Node]
- Kubelet: Closed a loophole that allowed static Pods to reference arbitrary ResourceClaims. Even though these Pods failed to run due to a sanity check, such references are now explicitly disallowed.
