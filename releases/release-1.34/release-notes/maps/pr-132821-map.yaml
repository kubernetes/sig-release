  text: "Introduced the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/MutatingAdmissionPolicy`
    API type. To enable, enable the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate (which
    was off by default) and set `--runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=true`
    on the kube-apiserver. \nNote that the default stored version remained alpha in
    1.34, and whoever enabled beta during 1.34 needed to run a storage migration yourself
    to ensure you don't depend on alpha data in etcd."
