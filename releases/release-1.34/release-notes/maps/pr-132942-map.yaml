  text: Added support for a new kubectl output format, `kyaml`. KYAML was a strict
    subset of YAML and should be accepted by any YAML processor. The formatting of
    KYAML was halfway between JSON and YAML.  Because it was more explicit than the
    default YAML style, it was less error-prone.
