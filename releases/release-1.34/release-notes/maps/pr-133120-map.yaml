    Added 3 new metrics for monitoring async API calls in the scheduler when the `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` feature gate was enabled:
      - `scheduler_async_api_call_execution_total`: tracks executed API calls by call type and result (success/error)
      - `scheduler_async_api_call_duration_seconds`: histogram of API call execution duration by call type and result
      - `scheduler_pending_async_api_calls`: gauge showing current number of pending API calls in the queue.
