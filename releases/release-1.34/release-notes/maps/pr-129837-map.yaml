    When proxying to an aggregated API server, kube-apiserver used the
    `EndpointSlices` of the `service` indicated by the `APIServer`, rather than
    using Endpoints.

    For users of the aggregated API server feature, who manually wrote out endpoints (rather than letting kube-controller-manager
    generate `Endpoints` and `EndpointSlices` for it automatically based on the
    Service definition), an endpoint slice was required instead of (or in addition to) an `Endpoints` object.
