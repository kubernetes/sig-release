  text: Updated `kubeadm` to use the `InitialCorruptCheck=true` etcd feature gate
    instead of the deprecated `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` flag. Also replaced
    the use of `--experimental-watch-progress-notify-interval` with its graduated
    counterpart `--watch-progress-notify-interval`.
