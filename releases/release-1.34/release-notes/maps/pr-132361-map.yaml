  text: Migrated validation in `CertificateSigningRequest` to use declarative validation.
    When the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing
    validation are reported via metrics. If `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` is enabled,
    declarative validation becomes the primary source of errors for migrated fields.
