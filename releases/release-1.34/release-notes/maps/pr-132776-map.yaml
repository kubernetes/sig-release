  text: '`kubeadm`: Started using a named port `probe-port` for all probes in the
    static pod manifests generated by `kubeadm` for the `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`,
    `kube-scheduler`, and related components. If probe port values were previously
    patched using `kubeadm` patches, the corresponding named port under the container’s
    `ports` field must now also be patched.'
