releasenote:
  text: Added a delay to node updates after kubelet startup. A random offset, based
    on the configured `nodeStatusReportFrequency`, helped distribute traffic and load
    from node status updates more evenly over time. The initial status update could
    occur up to 50% earlier or later than the regular schedule.
