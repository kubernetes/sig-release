releasenote:
  text: Modified the node-local `podresources` API endpoint to consider only active
    pods. Since this changes long-standing behavior, the `KubeletPodResourcesListUseActivePods`
    feature gate (enabled by default) can be disabled to restore the previous behavior.
    Users encountering regressions are encouraged to file an issue if they rely on
    the old behavior.
