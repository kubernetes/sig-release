## WARNING: etcd backup strongly recommended

Before updating to 1.6, you are strongly recommended to back up your etcd data.
Please consult the installation procedure you are using (kargo, kops, kube-up,
kube-aws, kubeadm etc) for specific advice.

1.6 encourages etcd3, and switching from etcd2 to etcd3 involves a full
migration of data between different storage engines.  You must stop the API
from writing to etcd during an etcd2 -> etcd3 migration.  HA installations cannot
be migrated at the current time using the official Kubernetes procedure.

1.6 will also default to protobuf encoding if using etcd3.  **This change is
irreversible.**  To rollback, you must restore from a backup made before the
protobuf/etcd3 switch, and any changes since the backup will be lost.  As 1.5
does not support protobuf encoding, if you roll back to 1.5 after upgrading to
protobuf you will be forced to restore from backup, and you will lose any changes
since you converted to protobuf.  After conversion to protobuf, you should
validate the correct operation of your cluster thoroughly before returning it
to normal operation.

Backups are always a good precaution, particularly around upgrades, but this
upgrade has multiple known issues where the only remedy is to restore from
backup.

Also, please note:
- using `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf` as the media storage type for 1.6 is default but not required
- the ability to rollback to etcd2 can be preserved by continuing to use `application/json` as the storage media type. This can be changed to `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf` at a later time.

## Major updates and release themes

* Kubernetes now supports up to 5,000 nodes via etcd v3, which is enabled by default.
* [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io//docs/admin/authorization/rbac) has graduated to beta, and defines secure default roles for control plane, node, and controller components.
* The [`kubeadm` cluster bootstrap tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/) has graduated to beta. Some highlights:
  * All communication is now over TLS
  * Authorization plugins can be installed by kubeadm, including the new default of RBAC
  * The bootstrap token system now allows token management and expiration
* The [`kubefed` federation bootstrap tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/federation/set-up-cluster-federation-kubefed/) has also graduated to beta.
* Interaction with container runtimes is now through the CRI interface, enabling easier integration of runtimes with the kubelet. Docker remains the default runtime via Docker-CRI (which moves to beta).
* Various scheduling features have graduated to beta:
  * You can now use [multiple schedulers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-schedulers/)
  * [Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#node-affinity-beta-feature) and [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity-beta-feature) now support affinity and anti-affinity
  * Advanced scheduling can be performed with [taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#taints-and-tolerations-beta-feature)
* You can now specify (per pod) how long a pod should stay bound to a node, when there is a node problem. 
* Various storage features have graduated to GA:
  * StorageClass pre-installed and set as default on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack, and vSphere
  * Configurable [Dynamic Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#dynamic) and [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#storageclasses)
* DaemonSets [can now be updated by a rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set).

## Action Required

### Certificates API
* Users of the alpha certificates API should delete v1alpha1 CSRs from the API before upgrading and recreate them as v1beta1 CSR after upgrading. ([#39772](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39772), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))

### Cluster Autoscaler
* If you are using (or planning to use) Cluster Autoscaler please wait for Kubernetes 1.6.1. In 1.6.0 Cluster Autoscaler 
may occasionally increase the size of the cluster a bit more than it is actually needed, when there are 
unschedulable pods, scale up is required and cloud provider is slow to set up networking for new nodes. 
Anyway, the cluster should get back to the proper size after 10 min.

### Deployment
* Deployment now fully respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods and ReplicaSets. At the time of upgrade, **you must not have Deployments with selectors that overlap**, or else [ownership of ReplicaSets may change](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/controller-ref.md#upgrading). ([#42175](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42175), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))

### Federation
* The --dns-provider argument of 'kubefed init' is now mandatory and does not default to `google-clouddns`. To initialize a Federation control plane with Google Cloud DNS, use the following invocation: 'kubefed init --dns-provider=google-clouddns' ([#42092](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42092), [@marun](https://github.com/marun))
* Cluster federation servers have changed the location in etcd where federated services are stored, so existing federated services must be deleted and recreated. Before upgrading, export all federated services from the federation server and delete the services. After upgrading the cluster, recreate the federated services from the exported data. ([#37770](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37770), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))

### Internal Storage Layer
* upgrade to etcd3 prior to upgrading to 1.6 **OR** explicitly specify `--storage-type=etcd2 --storage-media-type=application/json` when starting the apiserver

### Node Components
* **Kubelet with the Docker-CRI implementation**
  * The Docker-CRI implementation is enabled by default.
  * It is not compatible with containers created by older Kubelets. It is
    recommended to drain your node before upgrade. If you choose to perform
    an in-place upgrade, the Kubelet will automatically restart all
    Kubernetes-managed containers on the node.
  * It is not compatible with CNI plugins that do not conform to the
    [error handling behavior in the spec](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#network-configuration-list-error-handling).
    The plugins are being updated to resolve this issue ([#43488](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43488)).
    You can disable CRI explicitly (`--enable-cri=false`) as a
    temporary workaround.
      * The standard `bridge` plugin have been validated to interoperate with
         the new CRI + CNI code path.
      * If you are using plugins other than `bridge`, make sure you have
        updated custom plugins to the latest version that is compatible.
* **Enhance Kubelet QoS**:
  * Pods are placed under a new cgroup hierarchy by default. This feature requires
    draining and restarting the node as part of upgrades. To opt-out set
    `--cgroups-per-qos=false`.
  * If `kube-reserved` and/or `system-reserved` are specified, node allocatable
    will be enforced on all pods by default. To opt-out set
    `--enforce-node-allocatable=””`
  * Hard Eviction Thresholds will be subtracted from Capacity while calculating
    Node Allocatable. This will result in a reduction of schedulable capacity in
    clusters post upgrade where kubelet hard eviction has been turned on for
    memory. To opt-out set `--experimental-allocatable-ignore-eviction=true`.
  * More details on these feature here:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/node-allocatable/
* Drop the support for docker 1.9.x. Docker versions 1.10.3, 1.11.2, 1.12.6
  have been validated.
* The following deprecated kubelet flags are removed: `--config`, `--auth-path`,
  `--resource-container`, `--system-container`, `--reconcile-cidr`
* Remove the temporary fix for pre-1.0 mirror pods. Upgrade directly from
  pre-1.0 to 1.6 kubelet is not supported.
* Fluentd was migrated to Daemon Set, which targets nodes with
  beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true label. If you use fluentd in your
  cluster please make sure that the nodes with version 1.6+ contains this
  label.

### kubectl
* Running `kubectl taint` (alpha in 1.5) against a 1.6 server requires upgrading kubectl to version 1.6
* Running `kubectl taint` (alpha in 1.5) against a 1.5 server requires a kubectl version of 1.5
* Running `kubectl create secret` no longer accepts passing multiple values to a single --from-literal flag using comma separation
  * Update command invocations to pass separate --from-literal flags for each value

### RBAC
* Default ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding objects are automatically updated at server start to add missing permissions and subjects (extra permissions and subjects are left in place). To prevent autoupdating a particular role or rolebinding, annotate it with `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false`. ([#41155](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41155), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* `v1beta1` RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding subjects changed `apiVersion` to `apiGroup` to fully-qualify a subject. ServiceAccount subjects default to an apiGroup of `""`, User and Group subjects default to an apiGroup of `"rbac.authorization.k8s.io"`. ([#41184](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41184), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* To create or update an RBAC RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding object, a user must: ([#39383](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39383), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
    * 1. Be authorized to make the create or update API request
    * 2. Be allowed to bind the referenced role, either by already having all of the permissions contained in the referenced role, or by having the "bind" permission on the referenced role.
* The `--authorization-rbac-super-user` flag (alpha in 1.5) is deprecated; the `system:masters` group has privileged access ([#38121](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38121), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* special handling of the user `*` in RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding objects is removed in v1beta1. To match all users, explicitly bind to the group `system:authenticated` and/or `system:unauthenticated`. Existing v1alpha1 bindings to the user `*` are automatically converted to the group `system:authenticated`. ([#38981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38981), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### Scheduling
* **Multiple schedulers**
  * Modify your PodSpecs that currently use the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation on Pod, to instead use the `schedulerName` field in the PodSpec.
  * Modify any custom scheduler(s) you have written so that they read the `schedulerName` field on Pod instead of the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation. 
  * Note that you can only start using the `schedulerName` field **after** you upgrade to 1.6; it is not recognized in 1.5.

* **Node affinity/anti-affinity and pod affinity/anti-affinity**
  * You can continue to use the alpha version of this feature (with one caveat -- see below), in which you specify affinity requests using Pod annotations, in 1.6 by including `AffinityInAnnotations=true` in `--feature-gates`, such as `--feature-gates=FooBar=true,AffinityInAnnotations=true`. Otherwise, you must modify your PodSpecs that currently use the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity` annotation on Pod, to instead use the `affinity` field in the PodSpec. Support for the annotation will be removed in a future release, so we encourage you to switch to using the field as soon as possible.
  * Caveat: The alpha version no longer supports, and the beta version does not support, the "empty `podAffinityTerm.namespaces` list means all namespaces" behavior. In both alpha and beta it now means "same namespace as the pod specifying this affinity rule."
  * Note that you can only start using the `affinity` field **after** you upgrade to 1.6; it is not recognized in 1.5.
  * The `--failure-domains` scheduler command line-argument is not supported in the beta version of the feature.

* **Taints**
  * You will need to use `kubectl taint` to re-create all of your taints after kubectl and the master are upgraded to 1.6. Between the time the master is upgraded to 1.6 and when you do this, your existing taints will have no effect. 
  * You can find out what taints you have in place on a node while you are still running Kubernetes 1.5 by doing `kubectl describe node <node name>`; the `Taints` section will show the taints you have in place. To see the taints that were created under 1.5 when you are running 1.6, do `kubectl get node <node name> -o yaml` and look for the "Annotation" section with the annotation key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints`
  * You can remove the "old" taints (stored internally as annotations) at any time after the upgrade by doing `kubectl annotate nodes <node name> scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints-` (note the minus at the end, which means "delete the taint with this key")
  * Note that because any taints you might have created with Kubernetes 1.5 can only affect the scheduling of new pods (the `NoExecute` taint effect is introduced in 1.6), neither the master upgrade nor your running `kubectl taint` to re-create the taints will affect pods that are already running.
  * Rescheduler relies on taints, which were changed in a backward incompatible way. Rescheduler 0.3 shipped together with Kubernetes 1.6 understands the new taints and will clean up the old annotations, but Rescheduler 0.2 shipped together with Kubernetes 1.5 doesn't understand the new taints. In order to avoid eviction loop during 1.5->1.6 upgrade you need to either upgrade the master node atomically (for example by using `upgrade.sh` script for GCE) or ensure that the rescheduler is upgraded first, then the scheduler and then all the other master components.

* **Tolerations**
  * After your master is upgraded to 1.6, you will need to update your PodSpecs to set the `tolerations` field of the PodSpec and remove the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` annotation on the Pod. (It's not strictly necessary to remove the annotation, as it will have no effect once you upgrade to 1.6.) Between the time the master is upgraded to 1.6 and when you do this, tolerations attached to Pods that are created will have no effect. Pods that are already running will not be affected by the upgrade.
  * You can find the PodSpec tolerations that were created as annotations (if any) in a controller definition by doing `kubectl get <controller kind> <controller name> -o yaml` and looking for the "Annotation" section with the annotation key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` (This will work whether you are running Kubernetes 1.5 or 1.6).
  * To update a controller's PodSpec to use the field instead of the annotation, use one of the kubectl commands that do update ("kubectl replace" or "kubectl apply" or "kubectl patch") or just delete the controller entirely and re-create it with a new pod template. Note that you will be able to do these things only after the upgrade.

### Service
* The 'endpoints.beta.kubernetes.io/hostnames-map' annotation is no longer supported.  Users can use the 'Endpoints.subsets[].addresses[].hostname' field instead. ([#39284](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39284), [@bowei](https://github.com/bowei))

### StatefulSet
* StatefulSet now respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods. At the time of upgrade, **you must not have StatefulSets with selectors that overlap** with any other controllers (such as ReplicaSets), or else [ownership of Pods may change](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/controller-ref.md#upgrading). ([#42080](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42080), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))

### Volume
* StorageClass pre-installed and set as default on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack, and vSphere.
  * This is something to pay close attention to if you’ve been using Kubernetes for a while, because it changes the default behavior of PersistentVolumeClaim objects on these clouds.
  * Marking a StorageClass as default makes it so that even a PersistentVolumeClaim without a StorageClass specified will trigger dynamic provisioning (instead of binding to an existing pool of PVs).
  * If you depend on the old behavior of volumes binding to existing pool of PersistentVolume objects then modify the StorageClass object and set `storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` to `false`.
* Flex volume plugin is updated to support attach/detach interfaces. It broke backward compatibility. Please update your drivers and implement the new callouts.  ([#41804](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41804), [@chakri-nelluri](https://github.com/chakri-nelluri))

## Notable Features
Features for this release were tracked via the use of the [kubernetes/features](https://github.com/kubernetes/features) issues repo.  Each Feature issue is owned by a Special Interest Group from the [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).

### Autoscaling
* **[alpha]** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler now supports drawing metrics through the API server aggregator.
* **[alpha]** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler now supports scaling on multiple, custom metrics.
* Cluster Autoscaler publishes its status to kube-system/cluster-autoscaler-status ConfigMap.
* Cluster Autoscaler can continue operations while some nodes are broken or unready.
* Cluster Autoscaler respects Pod Disruption Budgets when removing a node.

### DaemonSets
* **[beta]** Introduce the rolling update feature for DaemonSet. See [Performing a Rolling Update on a DaemonSet](https://deploy-preview-2878--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/).

### Deployments
* **[beta]** Deployments that cannot make progress in rolling out the newest version will now indicate via the API they are blocked ([docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/deployments/#deployment-status))

### Federation
* **[beta]** `kubefed` has graduated to beta: supports hosting federation on on-prem clusters, automatically configures `kube-dns` in joining clusters and allows passing arguments to federation components.

### Internal Storage Layer
* **[stable]** The internal storage layer for kubernetes cluster state has been updated to use etcd v3 by default. Existing clusters will have to plan for a data migration window. ([docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/pull/2763))([kubernetes/features#44](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/44))

### kubeadm
* **[beta]** Introduces an API for clients to request TLS certificates from the API server. See the [tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster).
* **[beta]** kubeadm is enhanced and improved with a baseline feature set and command line flags that are now marked as beta. Other parts of kubeadm, including subcommands under `kubeadm alpha`, are [still in alpha](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/).  Using it is considered safe, although note that upgrades and HA are not yet supported. Please [try it out](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/) and [give us feedback](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/#feedback)!
* **[alpha]** New Bootstrap Token authentication and management method. Works well with kubeadm. kubeadm now supports managing tokens, including time based expiration, after the cluster is launched.  See [kubeadm reference docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/#manage-tokens) for details.
* **[alpha]** Adds a new cloud-controller-manager binary that may be used for testing the new out-of-core cloudprovider flow.

### Node Components
* **[stable]** Init containers have graduated to GA and now appear as a field.
  The beta annotation value will still be respected and overrides the field
  value.
* Kubelet Container Runtime Interface (CRI) support 
  - **[beta]** The Docker-CRI implementation is enabled by default in kubelet.
    You can disable it by --enable-cri=false. See
    [notes on the new implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md#kubernetes-v16-release-docker-cri-integration-beta)
    for more details.
  - **[alpha]** Alpha support for other runtimes:
    [cri-o](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/releases/tag/v0.1), [frakti](https://github.com/kubernetes/frakti/releases/tag/v0.1), [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fcri).
* **[beta]** Node Problem Detector is beta (v0.3.0) now. New
  features added into node-problem-detector:v0.3.0:
  - Add support for journald.
  - The ability to monitor any system daemon logs. Previously only kernel
    logs were supported.
  - The ability to be deployed and run as a native daemon.
* **[alpha]** Critical Pods: When feature gate "ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation" is
  set to true, the system will guarantee scheduling and admission of pods with
  the following annotation - `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod`
  - This feature should be used in conjunction with the
    [rescheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/rescheduler/) to guarantee
    resource availability for critical system pods.
* **[alpha]** `--experimental-nvidia-gpus` flag is replaced by `Accelerators` alpha
  feature gate along with addition of support for multiple Nvidia GPUs.
  - To use GPUs, pass `Accelerators=true` as part of `--feature-gates` flag.
  - More information [here](https://vishh.github.io/docs/user-guide/gpus/).
* A pod’s Quality of Service Class is now available in its Status.
* Upgrade cAdvisor library to v0.25.0. Notable changes include,
  - Container filesystem usage tracking disabled for device mapper due to excessive
    IOPS.
  - Ignore `.mount` cgroups, fixing disappearing stats.
* A new field `terminationMessagePolicy` has been added to containers that allows
  a user to request FallbackToLogsOnError, which will read from the container's
  logs to populate the termination message if the user does not write to the
  termination message log file. The termination message file is now properly
  readable for end users and has a maximum size (4k bytes) to prevent abuse.
  Each pod may have up to 12k bytes of termination messages before the contents
  of each will be truncated.
* Do not delete pod objects until all its compute resource footprint has been
  reclaimed.
  - This feature prevents the node and scheduler from oversubscribing resources
    that are still being used by a pod in the process of being cleaned up.
  - This feature can result in increase of Pod Deletion latency especially if the
    pod has a large filesystem footprint.

### RBAC
* **[beta]** RBAC API is promoted to v1beta1 (rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1), and defines default roles for control plane, node, and controller components.
* **[beta]** The Docker-CRI implementation is Beta and is enabled by default in kubelet.  You can disable it by `--enable-cri=false`. See [notes on the new implementation]( https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md#kubernetes-v16-release-docker-cri-integration-beta) for more details.

### Scheduling
- **[beta]** The [multiple schedulers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-schedulers/). This feature allows you to run multiple schedulers in parallel, each responsible for different sets of pods. When using multiple schedulers, the scheduler name is now specified in a new-in-1.6 `schedulerName` field of the PodSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name` annotation on the Pod. When you upgrade to 1.6, the Kubernetes default scheduler will start using the `schedulerName` field of the PodSpec and will ignore the annotation. 
- **[beta]** [Node affinity/anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/) and **[beta]** [pod affinity/anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/). Node affinity/anti-affinity allow you to specify rules for restricting which node(s) a pod can schedule onto, based on the labels on the node. Pod affinity/anti-affinity allow you to specify rules for spreading and packing pods relative to one another, across arbitrary topologies (node, zone, etc.) These affinity rules are now be specified in a new-in-1.6 `affinity` field of the PodSpec. Kubernetes 1.6 continues to support the alpha `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity` annotation on the Pod if you explicitly enable the alpha feature "AffinityInAnnotations", but it will be removed in a future release. When you upgrade to 1.6, if you have not enabled the alpha feature, then the scheduler will use the `affinity` field in PodSpec and will ignore the annotation. If you have enabled the alpha feature, then the scheduler will use the `affinity` field in PodSpec if it is present, and otherwise will use the annotation.
- **[beta]** [Taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/). This feature allows you to specify rules for "repelling" pods from nodes by default, which enables use cases like dedicated nodes and reserving nodes with special features for pods that need those features. We've also added a `NoExecute` taint type that evicts already-running pods, and an associated `tolerationSeconds` field to tolerations to delay the eviction for a specified amount of time. As before, taints are created using `kubectl taint` (but internally they are now represented as a field `taints` in the NodeSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/taints` annotation on Node). Tolerations are now specified in a new-in-1.6 `tolerations` field of the PodSpec rather than using the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerations` annotation on the Pod. When you upgrade to 1.6, the scheduler will start using the fields and will ignore the annotations.
- **[alpha]** Represent node problems "not ready" and "unreachable" using `NoExecute` taints. In combination with `tolerationSeconds` described below, this allows per-pod specification of how long to remain bound to a node that becomes unreachable or not ready, rather than using the default of 5 minutes. You can enable this alpha feature by including `TaintBasedEvictions=true` in `--feature-gates`, such as `--feature-gates=FooBar=true,TaintBasedEvictions=true`. Documentation is [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/).

### Service Catalog
- **[alpha]** Adds a new API resource `PodPreset` and admission controller to enable defining cross-cutting injection of Volumes and Environment into Pods.

### Volumes
* **[stable]** StorageClass API is promoted to v1 (storage.k8s.io/v1).
* **[stable]** Default storage classes are deployed during installation on Azure, AWS, GCE, OpenStack and vSphere.
* **[stable]** Added ability to populate environment variables from a configmap or secret.
* **[stable]** Support for user-written/run dynamic PV provisioners. The Kubernetes Incubator contains [a golang library and examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage).
* **[stable]** Volume plugin for ScaleIO enabling pods to seamlessly access and use data stored on Dell EMC ScaleIO volumes.
* **[stable]** Volume plugin for Portworx added capability to use [Portworx](http://www.portworx.com) as a storage provider for Kubernetes clusters. Portworx pools server capacity and turns servers or cloud instances into converged, highly available compute and storage nodes.
* **[stable]** Add support to use NFSv3, NFSv4, and GlusterFS on GCE/GKE GCI image based clusters.
* **[beta]** Added support for mount options in persistent volumes.
* **[alpha]** All in one volume proposal - a new volume driver capable of projecting secrets, configmaps, and downward API items into the same directory.
* **[alpha]** Flex volume API and Improved lifecycle (flexvolume).

## Deprecations
* Remove extensions/v1beta1 Jobs resource, and job/v1beta1 generator. ([#38614](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38614), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
* `federation/deploy/deploy.sh` was an interim solution introduced in Kubernetes v1.4 to simplify the federation control plane deployment experience. Now that we have `kubefed`, we are deprecating `deploy.sh` scripts. ([#38902](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38902), [@madhusudancs](https://github.com/madhusudancs))


### Cluster Provisioning Scripts
* The bash AWS deployment via kube-up.sh has been deprecated. See http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/ for alternatives. ([#38772](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38772), [@zmerlynn](https://github.com/zmerlynn))
* Remove Azure kube-up as the Azure community has focused efforts elsewhere. ([#41672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41672), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))
* Remove the deprecated vsphere kube-up. ([#39140](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39140), [@kerneltime](https://github.com/kerneltime))

### Other Deprecations
* Remove cmd/kube-discovery from the tree since it's not necessary anymore ([#42070](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42070), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))

#### kubeadm
* Quite a few flags been renamed or removed.  Those options that are removed as flags can still be accessed via the config file.  Most notably this includes external etcd settings and the option for setting the cloud provider on the API server.  The [kubeadm reference documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubeadm/) is up to date with the new flags.

## Changes to API Resources
### ABAC
* ABAC policies using `"user":"*"` or `"group":"*"` to match all users or groups will only match authenticated requests. To match unauthenticated requests, ABAC policies must explicitly specify `"group":"system:unauthenticated"` ([#38968](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38968), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

    * "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class" does not have any special meaning. A default storage class
    * and  DefaultStorageClass admission plugin can be used to preserve similar behavior of Kubernetes cluster,
    * see https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#class-1 for details.
* Reduce verbosity of volume reconciler when attaching volumes ([#36900](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36900), [@codablock](https://github.com/codablock))
* We change the default attach_detach_controller sync period to 1 minute to reduce the query frequency through cloud provider to check whether volumes are attached or not.  ([#41363](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41363), [@jingxu97](https://github.com/jingxu97))

* Create configmap for the cluster kube-dns when cluster joins and remove when it unjoins ([#39338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39338), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))
* Support configuring dns-provider ([#40528](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40528), [@shashidharatd](https://github.com/shashidharatd))
* Bug fix relating kubeconfig path in kubefed init ([#41410](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41410), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))
* Add override flags options to kubefed init ([#40917](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40917), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))
* Add option to expose federation apiserver on nodeport service ([#40516](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40516), [@shashidharatd](https://github.com/shashidharatd))
* Add option to disable persistence storage for etcd ([#40862](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40862), [@shashidharatd](https://github.com/shashidharatd))
* kubefed init creates a service account for federation controller manager in the federation-system namespace and binds that service account to the federation-system:federation-controller-manager role that has read and list access on secrets in the federation-system namespace.  ([#40392](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40392), [@madhusudancs](https://github.com/madhusudancs))
* Implement dry run support in kubefed init ([#36447](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36447), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))
* Make federation etcd PVC size configurable ([#36310](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36310), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))

#### Other Notable Changes
* Federated Ingress over GCE no longer requires separate firewall rules to be created for each cluster to circumvent flapping firewall health checks. ([#41942](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41942), [@csbell](https://github.com/csbell))
* Add support for finalizers in federated configmaps (deletes configmaps from underlying clusters). ([#40464](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40464), [@csbell](https://github.com/csbell))
* Add support for DeleteOptions.OrphanDependents for federated services. Setting it to false while deleting a federated service also deletes the corresponding services from all registered clusters. ([#36390](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36390), [@nikhiljindal](https://github.com/nikhiljindal))
* Add `--controllers` flag to federation controller manager for enable/disable federation ingress controller ([#36643](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36643), [@kzwang](https://github.com/kzwang))
* Stop deleting services from underlying clusters when federated service is deleted. ([#37353](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37353), [@nikhiljindal](https://github.com/nikhiljindal))
* Expose autoscaling apis through federation api server ([#38976](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38976), [@irfanurrehman](https://github.com/irfanurrehman))
* Federation: Add `batch/jobs` API objects to federation-apiserver ([#35943](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35943), [@jianhuiz](https://github.com/jianhuiz))
* Add logging of route53 calls ([#39964](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39964), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

### Garbage Collector
* Added foreground garbage collection: the owner object will not be deleted until all its dependents are deleted by the garbage collector. Please checkout the [user doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/garbage-collection/) for details. ([#38676](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38676), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
  * deleteOptions.orphanDependents is going to be deprecated in 1.7. Please use deleteOptions.propagationPolicy instead.

### kubeadm
* A new label and taint is used for marking the master. The label is `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=""` and the taint has the effect `NoSchedule`. Tolerate the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master="":NoSchedule` taint to schedule a workload on the master (a networking DaemonSet for example).
* The kubelet API is now secured, only cluster admins are allowed to access it.
* Insecure access to the API Server over `localhost:8080` is now disabled.
* The control plane components now talk securely to each other. The API Server talks securely to the kubelets in the cluster.
* kubeadm creates RBAC-enabled clusters. This means that some add-ons which worked previously won't work without having their YAML configuration updated. Please see each vendor's own documentation to check that the add-ons you are using will work with Kubernetes 1.6.
* The kube-discovery Deployment isn't used anymore when creating a kubeadm cluster and shouldn't be used anywhere else either due to its insecure nature.
* The Certificates API has graduated from alpha to beta. This is a backwards-incompatible change since the alpha support is dropped, and therefore kubeadm v1.5 and v1.6 don't work together (for example kubeadm v1.5 can't join a kubeadm v1.6 cluster).
* Supporting only etcd3, with 3.0.14 as the minimum version.
* `kubeadm reset` will no longer drain nodes automatically.  This is because the credentials on nodes do not have permission to perform this operation.  We have documented an [alternate procedure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/#tear-down), driven from the API server/master.
* Hook up kubeadm against the BootstrapSigner ([#41417](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41417), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Rename some flags for beta UI and fixup some logic ([#42064](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42064), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Insecure access to the API Server at localhost:8080 will be turned off in v1.6 when using kubeadm ([#42066](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42066), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Flag --use-kubernetes-version for kubeadm init renamed to --kubernetes-version ([#41820](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41820), [@kad](https://github.com/kad))
* Remove the --cloud-provider flag for beta init UX ([#41710](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41710), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Fixed an SELinux issue in kubeadm on Docker 1.12+ by moving etcd SELinux options from container to pod. ([#40682](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40682), [@dgoodwin](https://github.com/dgoodwin))
* Add authorization mode to kubeadm ([#39846](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39846), [@andrewrynhard](https://github.com/andrewrynhard))
* Refactor the certificate and kubeconfig code in the kubeadm binary into two phases ([#39280](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39280), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))
* Added kubeadm commands to manage bootstrap tokens and the duration they are valid for. ([#35805](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35805), [@dgoodwin](https://github.com/dgoodwin))

* Begin paths for internationalization in kubectl ([#36802](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36802), [@brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))
  * Add initial french translations for kubectl ([#40645](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40645), [@brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))

#### Updates to apply

* Warn user when using `apply` on a resource lacking the `LastAppliedConfig` annotation ([#36672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36672), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
* PATCH (i.e. apply and edit) now supports merging lists of primitives ([#38665](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38665), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
* `apply` falls back to generic 3-way JSON merge patch for Third Party Resource or unregistered types ([#40666](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40666), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))

#### Updates to edit
* `edit` now supports Third party resources and extension API servers. ([#41304](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41304), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  * Now to edit a particular API version, provide the fully-qualify the resource, version, and group used to fetch the object (for example, `job.v1.batch/myjob`)
  * Client-side conversion is no longer done, and the `--output-version` option is deprecated for `kubectl edit`.
* `edit` works as intended with apply and will not change the annotation
  * No longer updates the last-applied-configuration annotation when --save-config is unspecified or false. ([#41924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41924), [@ymqytw](https://github.com/ymqytw))
  * Fixes issue that caused apply to revert changes made by edit

#### Bug fixes
* Fixed --save-config in create subcommand to save the annotation ([#40289](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40289), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))
* Fixed an issue where 'kubectl get --sort-by=' would return an error if the specified fields in sort were not specified in one or more of the returned objects. ([#40541](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40541), [@fabianofranz](https://github.com/fabianofranz))
  * Previously this would cause the command to fail regardless of whether or not the field was present in the object model
  * Now the command will succeed even if the sort-by field is missing from one or more of the objects
* Fixed issue with kubectl proxy so it will now proxy an empty path - e.g. http://localhost:8001 ([#39226](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39226), [@luksa](https://github.com/luksa))
* Fixed an issue where commas were not accepted in --from-literal flags for the creation of secrets. ([#35191](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35191), [@SamiHiltunen](https://github.com/SamiHiltunen))

#### Other Notable Changes
* The api server will publish the extensions/Deployments API as preferred over the apps/Deployment (introduced in 1.6). ([#43553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43553), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  * This will ensure certain commands in 1.5 versions of kubectl continue function when run against a 1.6 server. (e.g. `kubectl edit deployment`) 
* Taint
  * The `taint` command will not function in a skewed 1.5 / 1.6 environment - client and server versions must match (See Action required section above)
  * Change taints/tolerations to api fields ([#38957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38957), [@aveshagarwal](https://github.com/aveshagarwal))

* `--output-version` is ignored for all commands except `kubectl convert`.  This is consistent with the generic nature of `kubectl` CRUD commands and the previous removal of `--api-version`.  Specific versions can be specified in the resource field: `resource.version.group`, `jobs.v1.batch`. ([#41576](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41576), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* Allow missing keys in templates by default ([#39486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39486), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))
* Add error message when trying to use clusterrole with namespace in kubectl ([#36424](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/36424), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))
* When deleting an object with `--grace-period=0`, the client will begin a graceful deletion and wait until the resource is fully deleted.  To force deletion, use the `--force` flag. ([#37263](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37263), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* NodeNotReady on failed PLEG health check.
  ([#41569](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41569),
  [@yujuhong](https://github.com/yujuhong))
* CRI: upgrade protobuf to v3. Protobuf v2 and v3 are not compatible.
  ([#39158](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39158), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))
* kubelet exports metrics for cgroup management (#41988, @sjenning)
* Experimental support to reserve a pod's memory request from being utilized by
  pods in lower QoS tiers.
  ([#41149](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41149),
  [@sjenning](https://github.com/sjenning))
* Port forwarding can forward over websockets or SPDY.
  ([#33684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/33684),
  [@fraenkel](https://github.com/fraenkel))
* Flag gate faster evictions based on node memory pressure using kernel memcg
  notifications - `--experimental-kernel-memcg-notification`.
  ([#38258](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38258),
  [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr)) 
* Nodes can now report two additional address types in their status: InternalDNS
  and ExternalDNS. The apiserver can use --kubelet-preferred-address-types to
  give priority to the type of address it uses to reach nodes.
  ([#34259](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34259), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

#### Bug fixes
* Add image cache to fix the issue where kubelet hands when reporting the node
  status. ([#38375](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38375),
  [@Random-Liu](https://github.com/Random-Liu))
* Fix logic error in graceful deletion that caused pods not being able to
  be deleted. ([#37721](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/37721),
  [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))

### kube-dns
* Adds support for configurable DNS stub domains and upstream nameservers.
  The following configuration options have been added to the `kube-system:kube-dns` ConfigMap:
  ```
  "stubDomains": {
    "acme.local": ["1.2.3.4"]
  },
  ```
  is a map of domain to list of nameservers for the domain. This is used
  to inject private DNS domains into the kube-dns namespace. In the above
  example, any DNS requests for *.acme.local will be served by the
  nameserver 1.2.3.4.
  ```
  "upstreamNameservers": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  ```
  is a list of upstreamNameservers to use, overriding the configuration
  specified in /etc/resolv.conf.
  
* An empty `kube-system:kube-dns` ConfigMap will be created for the cluster if one did not already exist.

### kube-proxy

  kube-system:kube-dns configmap:
  ```
  "stubDomains": {
  "acme.local": ["1.2.3.4"]
   },
  ```
  
  is a map of domain to list of nameservers for the domain. This is used
  to inject private DNS domains into the kube-dns namespace. In the above
  example, any DNS requests for `*.acme.local` will be served by the
  ```
  nameserver 1.2.3.4.
  ```
  
  ```
  upstreamNameservers": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  ```
  is a list of upstreamNameservers to use, overriding the configuration
  specified in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* `kube-dns` now runs using a separate `system:serviceaccount:kube-system:kube-dns` service account which is automatically bound to the correct RBAC permissions. ([#38816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38816), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
