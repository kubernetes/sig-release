- Move all non release blocking issues into the 1.6.1 or 1.7 milestones by 2017-03-10
- Assign owners for each blocking issue from each SIG for all remaining release blocking issues
- Provide status updates within 24hrs for all flakes assigned to your SIG

## Bugs
- [Total in Milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20milestone%3Av1.6): 17

### Action Required
- Bug owners please provide regular status updates for all bugs with fix or triage in progress

### Action Required
- SIG Node address Garbage Collection Test Regression
- StatefulSet regression addressed

## Suite Failures
- [GKE Serial](https://testgrid.k8s.io/google-gke#gke-serial)
- [GCE Examples](https://testgrid.k8s.io/google-gce#gce-examples)
- [GCE HA Master](https://testgrid.k8s.io/google-gce#gce-ha-master)
- [etcd Upgrades](https://testgrid.k8s.io/etcd-upgrades)

### Action Required
- GKE Suite Owner must be identified
- GCE Suite Owner must be identified

## Incomplete Features
- Open issues filed against [`kubernetes/features` in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6): 33

### Action Required
- Feature owners fill out feature template by 10 March 2017
- Feature owners submit docs PR which references issue in features repo by 13 March 2017
- Feature owners prepare release notes by 13 March 2017
- Address etcd upgrade test failures

## Release Machinery
- Version skew tests are still not up. This presents a major threat to the release schedule as it is impossible
  to verify regressions between minor release versions and mixed version clusters (as would exist during a rolling
  upgrade)

### Action Required
- Finish release infrastructure setup
