### Action required
- Ensure all issues in milestone are release blocking
- Ensure all issues in milestone have SIG routing label
- Ensure all issues opened by a human have an assignee. It's now possible to [assign people using prow](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/t6aceRk03Ag); thanks contribx!
- Move all non blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone **and into** *either* the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones 
- Close "broken test run" issues for transient test infrastructure failures 
- Close issues which have been addressed

#### Action Required
- Help route all flakes into SIGs
- **Do not open a flake issue without assigning a SIG to that issue**
- **Do not remove a milestone without assigning a new milestone**
- Move all non release blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone and into _either_ the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Assign owners for each blocking issue from each SIG for all remaining release blocking issues
- Provide status updates within 24hrs for all flakes assigned to your SIG

### Bugs
- [Total in milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20milestone%3Av1.6): 5 (-7 from last report)

#### Action Required
- Bug assignees please label all bugs with the appropriate SIG(s)
- **Bug assignees please move all non release blocking bugs out of the `v1.6` milestone** and into the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Bug assignees please provide regular status updates for all bugs with fix or triage in progress
- Bug assignees and SIGs please close fixed bugs
- As spare time allows *please* help to begin addressing bugs without a milestone. Some of these bugs can probably be closed but we should be kind to the community and address these issues.
