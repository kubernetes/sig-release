# Proposed timeline for 1.6
We will begin the 1.6 release the first week of 2017.
We will use the time between releases for planning, designing and bugfixes.

The proposal below is identical in layout to the 1.4 and 1.5 plans with some
modifications:
- as before, key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- some sigs will focus on stabilization for 1.6, and there may be fewer new
  feature proposals
- there are fewer major holidays and vacation breaks this quarter 

## 1.6 Release Schedule
- Dec 8 - Jan 3: planning/design/bugfix period
- Jan 3 (Tues) coding start (7w)
- Jan 24 (Tues) features repo freeze
- Jan 30th (Monday) v1.6.0-alpha.1
- Feb 13th (Monday) v1.6.0-alpha.2

## Notable operational changes

1. Starting in the 1.6 release the [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-1.6/release_team.md)
  will use the following procedure to identify release blocking issues
  1. Any issues listed in the [v1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6)
     will be considered release blocking. It is everyone's responsibility to move non blocking issues out of the `v1.6` milestone. Items targeting 1.7 can be moved into the `v1.7` milestone.
     milestones **or the release will not ship**
