## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Audit log files are now created with a mode of 0600. Existing file permissions will not be changed. If you need the audit file to be readable by a non-root user, you can pre-create the file with the desired permissions. ([#95387](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95387), [@JAORMX](https://github.com/JAORMX)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
 - CSI migration of AWS EBS volumes requires AWS EBS CSI driver ver. 1.0 that supports `allowAutoIOPSPerGBIncrease` parameter in StorageClass. ([#101082](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101082), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))
 - Conformance image is now built with Distroless. Users running Conformance testing should rely on container entrypoint instead of manual invocation to `/run_e2e.sh` or `/gorunner`, as they are now deprecated and will be removed in 1.25 release. Invoking `ginkgo` and `e2e.test` are still supported through overriding entrypoint (docker) or defining container `spec.command` (kubernetes). ([#99178](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99178), [@wilsonehusin](https://github.com/wilsonehusin))
 - Default `StreamingProxyRedirects` to disabled. If there is a >= 2 version skew between master and nodes, and the old nodes were enabling `--redirect-container-streaming`, this will break them. In this case, the `StreamingProxyRedirects` can still be manually enabled. ([#101647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101647), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
 - Intree volume plugin scaleIO support has been completely removed from Kubernetes. ([#101685](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101685), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227))
 - Kubeadm: remove the automatic detection and matching of cgroup drivers for Docker. For new clusters if you have not configured the cgroup driver explicitly you might get a failure in the `kubelet` on driver mismatch (kubeadm clusters should be using the `systemd` driver). Also remove the `IsDockerSystemdCheck` preflight check (warning) that checks if the Docker cgroup driver is set to `systemd`. Ideally such detection / coordination should be on the side of CRI implementers and the kubelet (tracked [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99808)). Please see the [page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/) on how to configure cgroup drivers with kubeadm manually ([#99647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99647), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
 - Kubeadm: the flag `--cri-socket` is no longer allowed in a mixture with the flag `--config`. Please use the kubeadm configuration for setting the CRI socket for a node using `{Init|Join}Configuration.nodeRegistration.criSocket`. ([#101600](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101600), [@KofClubs](https://github.com/KofClubs))
 - Newly provisioned PVs by Azure disk will no longer have the beta `FailureDomain` label. Azure disk volume plugin will start to have GA topology label instead. ([#101534](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101534), [@kassarl](https://github.com/kassarl))
 - Scheduler's CycleState now embeds internal read/write locking inside its `Read()` and `Write()` functions. Meanwhile, `Lock()` and `Unlock()` function are removed. Scheduler plugin developers are now required to remove `CycleState#Lock()` and `CycleState#Unlock()`. Just simply use `Read()` and `Write()` as they're natively thread-safe now. ([#101542](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101542), [@Huang-Wei](https://github.com/Huang-Wei))
 - The `CSIMigrationVSphereComplete` feature flag is removed. `InTreePluginvSphereUnregister` will be the way moving forward. ([#101272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101272), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227))
 - The flag `--experimental-patches` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. You can migrate to using the new flag `--patches`. Add a new field `{Init|Join}Configuration.patches.directory` that can be used for the same purpose. For `init` and `join` it is now recommended that you migrate to configure patches via `{Init|Join}Configuration.patches.directory`. For the time being, these flags can be mixed with `--config`, but that might change in the future. On a command line, the last *patches flag takes precedence over previous flags and the value in config. `kubeadm upgrade --patches` will continue to be the only available option, since `upgrade` does not support a configuration file yet. ([#103063](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103063), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Controller-manager: the following flags have no effect and would be removed in v1.24:
  - `--port`
  - `--address`
  The insecure port flags `--port` may only be set to 0 now.
  
  In addtion, please be careful that:
  - controller-manager MUST start with `--authorization-kubeconfig` and `--authentication-kubeconfig` correctly set to get authentication/authorization working.
  - liveness/readiness probes to controller-manager MUST use HTTPS now, and the default port has been changed to 10257.
  - Applications that fetch metrics from controller-manager should use a dedicated service account which is allowed to access nonResourceURLs `/metrics`. ([#96216](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96216), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Deprecate `--record` flag in `kubectl`. The `--record` flag is being replaced with the [mechanism](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-cli/859-kubectl-headers) which annotates HTTP requests with kubectl command details. ([#102873](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102873), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- E2e.test: removed the  `--viper-config` flag. If you were previously using this to pass flags to `e2e.test` via a file, you will need to pass them directly on the command line, e.g. `e2e.test --e2e-output-dir`. ([#102598](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102598), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- For `kubeadm`: remove the ClusterStatus API from v1beta3 and its management in the kube-system/kubeadm-config ConfigMap. This method of keeping track of what API endpoints exists in the cluster was replaced (in a prior release) by a method to annotate the etcd Pods that `kubeadm` creates in "stacked etcd" clusters. The following CLI sub-phases are deprecated and are now a NO-OP: for `kubeadm join`: "control-plane-join/update-status", for `kubeadm reset`: "update-cluster-status". Unless you are using these phases explicitly, you should not be affected. ([#101915](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101915), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubead: remove the deprecated `--csr-only` and `--csr-dir` flags from `kubeadm init phase certs`. Deprecate the same flags under `kubeadm certs renew`. In both the cases the command `kubeadm certs generate-csr` should be used instead. ([#102108](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102108), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Remove the deprecated command `kubeadm alpha kubeconfig`. Please use `kubeadm kubeconfig` instead. ([#101938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101938), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- Kubeadm: Remove the deprecated hyperkube image support in `v1beta3`. This implies removal of `ClusterConfiguration.UseHyperKubeImage.` ([#101537](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101537), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Remove the field `ClusterConfiguration.DNS.Type` in v1beta3 since CoreDNS is the only supported DNS type. ([#101547](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101547), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated command `kubeadm config view`. A replacement for this command is `kubectl get cm -n kube-system kubeadm-config -o=jsonpath="{.data.ClusterConfiguration}"` ([#102071](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102071), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated flag '--image-pull-timeout' for 'kubeadm upgrade apply' command ([#102093](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102093), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated flag `--insecure-port` from the kube-apiserver manifest that kubeadm manages. The flag had no effect since 1.20, since the insecure serving of the component was disabled in the same version. ([#102121](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102121), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated kubeadm API `v1beta1`. Introduce a new kubeadm API `v1beta3`. See [kubeadm/v1beta3](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/apis/kubeadm/v1beta3) for a list of changes since `v1beta2`. Note that `v1beta2` is not yet deprecated, but will be in a future release. ([#101129](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101129), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Newly provisioned PVs by vSphere in-tree plugin will no longer have the beta `FailureDomain` label. vSphere volume plugin will start to have GA topology label ([#102414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102414), [@divyenpatel](https://github.com/divyenpatel))
- Removal of the CSI `NodePublish` path by the kubelet is deprecated. This must be done by the CSI plugin according to the CSI spec. ([#101441](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101441), [@dobsonj](https://github.com/dobsonj))
- Remove support for the Service `topologyKeys` field (alpha) and the `kube-proxy` implementation of it. This field was deprecated several cycles ago. This functionality is replaced by the combination of automatic topology hints per-endpoint (alpha) and the Service `internalTrafficPolicy` field (alpha). ([#102412](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102412), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim))
- The `PodUnknown` phase is now deprecated. ([#95286](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95286), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- The `storageos`, `quobyte` and `flocker` storage volume plugins are deprecated and will be removed in a later release. ([#101773](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101773), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227))
- The deprecated flag `--hard-pod-affinity-symmetric-weight` and `--scheduler-name` have been removed from `kube-scheduler`. Use `ComponentConfig` instead to configure those parameters. ([#102805](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102805), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g))
- The feature Dynamic Kubelet Configuration is deprecated and kubelet will report warning when the flag `--dynamic-config-dir` is used. Feature gate `DynamicKubeletConfig` is disabled out of the box and needs to be explicitly enabled. ([#102966](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102966), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Instrumentation and Node]
- The in-tree azure and gcp auth plugins have been deprecated.  The https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin and gcloud commands serve as out-of-tree replacements via the kubectl/client-go credential plugin mechanism. ([#102181](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102181), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- The ingress `v1beta1` has been deprecated. ([#102030](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102030), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))

### API Change

- A new score extension for NodeResourcesFit plugin that merges the functionality of `NodeResourcesLeastAllocated`, `NodeResourcesMostAllocated`, `RequestedToCapacityRatio` plugins, which are marked as deprecated as of v1beta2. In v1beta1, the three plugins can still be used in v1beta1 but not at the same time with the score extension of `NodeResourcesFit`. ([#101822](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101822), [@yuzhiquan](https://github.com/yuzhiquan))
- A value of `Auto` is now a valid for the `service.kubernetes.io/topology-aware-hints` annotation. ([#100728](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100728), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott))
- Add `DataSourceRef` alpha field to PVC spec, which allows contents other than `PVCs` and `VolumeSnapshots` to be data sources. ([#103276](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103276), [@bswartz](https://github.com/bswartz))
- Add `PersistentVolumeClaimDeletePoilcy` to StatefulSet API. ([#99378](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99378), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
- Add a new Priority and Fairness rule that exempts all probes (`/readyz`, `/healthz`, `/livez`) to prevent restarting of healthy `kube-apiserver` instance by kubelet. ([#100678](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100678), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem))
- Add alpha support for HostProcess containers on Windows ([#99576](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99576), [@marosset](https://github.com/marosset)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node, Testing and Windows]
- Add distributed tracing to the `kube-apiserver`. It is can be enabled with the feature gate `APIServerTracing` ([#94942](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94942), [@dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole))
- Add three metrics to the job controller to monitor if a job works in healthy condition.
  `IndexedJob` has been promoted to Beta. ([#101292](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101292), [@AliceZhang2016](https://github.com/AliceZhang2016))
- Added field `.status.uncountedTerminatedPods` to the Job resource. This field is used by the job controller to keep track of finished pods before adding them to the Job status counters. Pods created by the job controller get the finalizer `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`
  Jobs that are tracked using this mechanism get the annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`. This is a temporary measure. Two releases after this feature graduates to beta, the annotation won't be added to Jobs anymore. ([#98817](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98817), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor))
- Added new kubelet alpha feature `SeccompDefault`. This feature enables falling back to
  the `RuntimeDefault` (former `runtime/default`) seccomp profile if nothing else is specified
  in the pod/container `SecurityContext` or the pod annotation level. To use the feature, enable
  the feature gate as well as set the kubelet configuration option `SeccompDefault`
  (`--seccomp-default`) to `true`. ([#101943](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101943), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG Node]
- Adds the `ReadWriteOncePod` access mode for `PersistentVolumes` and `PersistentVolumeClaims`. Restricts volume access to a single pod on a single node. ([#102028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102028), [@chrishenzie](https://github.com/chrishenzie))
- Alpha swap support can now be enabled on Kubernetes nodes with the `NodeSwapEnabled` feature flag. See [KEP-2400](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2400-node-swap/README.md#design-details) for details. ([#102823](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102823), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman))
- Because of the implementation logic of `time.Format` in golang, the displayed time zone is not consistent. ([#102366](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102366), [@cndoit18](https://github.com/cndoit18))
- Corrected the documentation for escaping dollar signs in a container's env, command and args property. ([#101916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101916), [@MartinKanters](https://github.com/MartinKanters)) [SIG Apps]
- Enable `MaxSurge` for `DaemonSet` by default. ([#101742](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101742), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))
- Enforce the `ReadWriteOncePod` PVC access mode during scheduling ([#103082](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103082), [@chrishenzie](https://github.com/chrishenzie))
- Ephemeral containers are now allowed to configure a `securityContext` that differs from that of the Pod. Cluster administrators should ensure that security policy controllers support `EphemeralContainers` before enabling this feature in clusters. ([#99023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99023), [@verb](https://github.com/verb))
- Exec plugin authors can override default handling of standard input via new `interactiveMode` kubeconfig field. ([#99310](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99310), [@ankeesler](https://github.com/ankeesler))
- If someone had the `ProbeTerminationGracePeriod` alpha feature enabled in 1.21, they should update/delete any workloads/pods with probe `terminationGracePeriods` < 1 before upgrading ([#103245](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103245), [@wzshiming](https://github.com/wzshiming))
- Improved parsing of label selectors ([#102188](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102188), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Introduce `minReadySeconds` api to the `StatefulSets`. ([#100842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100842), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))
- Introducing Memory quality of service support with `cgroups v2 (Alpha)`. The `MemoryQoS` feature is now in Alpha. This allows `kubelet` running with `cgroups v2` to set memory QoS at container, pod and QoS level to protect and guarantee better memory quality. This feature can be enabled through feature gate Memory QoS. ([#102970](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102970), [@borgerli](https://github.com/borgerli))
- Kube API server accepts `Impersonate-Uid` header to impersonate a user with a specific UID, in the same way that you can currently use `Impersonate-User`, `Impersonate-Group` and `Impersonate-Extra`. ([#99961](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99961), [@margocrawf](https://github.com/margocrawf))
- Kube-apiserver: Fixes handling of CRD schemas containing literal null values in enums ([#104988](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104988), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Network]
- Kube-apiserver: `--service-account-issuer` can be specified multiple times now, to enable non-disruptive change of issuer. ([#101155](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101155), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Kube-controller-manager: the `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients` flag and Heapster support in the horizontal pod autoscaler, deprecated since 1.12, is removed. ([#90368](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90368), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Kube-scheduler: a plugin enabled in a v1beta2 configuration file takes precedence over the default configuration for that plugin. This simplifies enabling default plugins with custom configuration without needing to explicitly disable those default plugins. ([#99582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99582), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave))
- New `node-high` priority-level has been added to Suggested API Priority and ([#101151](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101151), [@mborsz](https://github.com/mborsz))
- NodeSwapEnabled feature flag was renamed to NodeSwap
  
  The flag was only available in the 1.22.0-beta.1 release, and the new flag should be used going forward. ([#103553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103553), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman)) [SIG Node]
- Omit comparison with boolean constant ([#101523](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101523), [@chuntaochen](https://github.com/chuntaochen)) [SIG CLI and Cloud Provider]
- Removed the feature flag for probe-level termination grace period from Kubelet. If a user wants to disable this feature on already created pods, they will have to delete and recreate the pods. ([#103168](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103168), [@raisaat](https://github.com/raisaat)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Revert addition of Add `PersistentVolumeClaimDeletePoilcy` to `StatefulSet`API. ([#103747](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103747), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
- Scheduler could be configured  to consider new resources beside CPU and memory,  GPU for example, for the score plugin of `NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation`. ([#101946](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101946), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Server Side Apply now treats all <Some>Selector fields as atomic (meaning the entire selector is managed by a single writer and updated together), since they contain interrelated and inseparable fields that do not merge in intuitive ways. ([#97989](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97989), [@Danil-Grigorev](https://github.com/Danil-Grigorev)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Suspend Job feature graduated to beta. Added the `action` label to Job controller sync metrics `job_sync_total` and `job_sync_duration_seconds`. ([#102022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102022), [@adtac](https://github.com/adtac))
- The API documentation for the DaemonSet's `spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` field was corrected to state that the value is rounded up. ([#101296](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101296), [@Miciah](https://github.com/Miciah))
- The `CSIServiceAccountToken` graduates to Ga and is unconditionally enabled. ([#103001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103001), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang))
- The `CertificateSigningRequest.certificates.k8s.io` API supports an optional expirationSeconds field to allow the client to request a particular duration for the issued certificate.  The default signer implementations provided by the Kubernetes controller manager will honor this field as long as it does not exceed the --cluster-signing-duration flag. ([#99494](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99494), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))
- The `EndpointSlicen Mirroring controller` no longer mirrors the `last-applied-configuration` annotation created by `kubectl` to update `EndpointSlices`. ([#102731](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102731), [@sharmarajdaksh](https://github.com/sharmarajdaksh))
- The `NetworkPolicyEndPort` is graduated to beta and is enabled by default. ([#102834](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102834), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz))

- The `Server Side Apply` treats certain structs as atomic. Meaning the entire selector field is managed by a single writer and updated together. ([#100684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100684), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree))
- The `ServiceAppProtocol` feature gate has been removed. It reached GA in Kubernetes ([#103190](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103190), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott))
- The `TerminationGracePeriodSeconds` on pod specs and container probes should not be negative. Negative values of `TerminationGracePeriodSeconds` will be treated as the value `1s` on the delete path. Immutable field validation will be relaxed in order to update negative values. In a future release, negative values will not be permitted. ([#98866](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98866), [@wzshiming](https://github.com/wzshiming))
- The `kube-scheduler` component config `v1beta2` API available
  Three scheduler plugins deprecated (`NodeLabel`, `ServiceAffinity`, `NodePreferAvoidPods`). ([#99597](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99597), [@adtac](https://github.com/adtac))
- The `pod/eviction` subresource now accepts `policy/v1` eviction requests in addition to `policy/v1beta1` eviction requests ([#100724](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100724), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- The `podAffinity`, `NamespaceSelector` and the associated `CrossNamespaceAffinity` quota scope features graduate to Beta and they are now enabled by default. ([#101496](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101496), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g))
- The `pods/ephemeralcontainers` API now returns and expects a `Pod` object instead of `EphemeralContainers`. This is incompatible with the previous alpha-level API. ([#101034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101034), [@verb](https://github.com/verb)) [SIG Apps, Auth, CLI and Testing]
- The `v1.Node` and `.status.images[].names` are  now optional. ([#102159](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102159), [@roycaihw](https://github.com/roycaihw))
- The deprecated flag `--algorithm-provider` has been removed from `kube-scheduler`. Use instead `ComponentConfig` to configure the set of enabled plugins. ([#102239](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102239), [@Haleygo](https://github.com/Haleygo))
- The options `--ssh-user` and `--ssh-key` are removed. They only functioned on GCE, and only in-tree. Use the apiserver network proxy instead. ([#102297](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102297), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
- Track Job completion through status and Pod finalizers, removing dependency on Pod tombstones. ([#98238](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98238), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Testing]
- Track ownership of scale subresource for all scalable resources i.e. Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, ReplicationController, and Custom Resources. ([#98377](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98377), [@nodo](https://github.com/nodo)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]

### Feature

- A `system-cluster-critical` pod should not get a low OOM Score. 
  
  As of now both `system-node-critical` and `system-cluster-critical` pods have -997 OOM score, making them one of the last processes to be OOMKilled. By definition `system-cluster-critical` pods can be scheduled elsewhere if there is a resource crunch on the node where as `system-node-critical` pods cannot be rescheduled. This was the reason for `system-node-critical` to have higher priority value than `system-cluster-critical`.  This change allows only `system-node-critical` priority class to have low OOMScore.
  
  action required
  If the user wants to have the pod to be OOMKilled last and the pod has `system-cluster-critical` priority class, it has to be changed to `system-node-critical` priority class to preserve the existing behavior ([#99729](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99729), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))

- Adds feature gate `KubeletInUserNamespace` which enables support for running kubelet in a user namespace.
  
  The user namespace has to be created before running kubelet.
  All the node components such as CRI need to be running in the same user namespace.
  
  When the feature gate is enabled, kubelet ignores errors that happens during setting the following sysctl values: `vm.overcommit_memory`, `vm.panic_on_oom`, `kernel.panic`, `kernel.panic_on_oops`, `kernel.keys.root_maxkeys`, `kernel.keys.root_maxbytes`. (These sysctl values for the host, not for the containers)
  
  kubelet also ignores an error during opening `/dev/kmsg`.
  This feature gate also allows kube-proxy to ignore an error during setting `RLIMIT_NOFILE`.
  
  This feature gate is especially useful for running Kubernetes inside Rootless Docker/Podman with `kind` or `minikube`. ([#92863](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92863), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda)) [SIG Network, Node and Testing]

### Bug or Regression

- A pod that the Kubelet rejects was still considered as being accepted for a brief period of time after rejection, which might cause some pods to be rejected briefly that could fit on the node.  A pod that is still terminating (but has status indicating it has failed) may also still be consuming resources and so should also be considered.

- Kubeadm: during execution of the "check expiration" command, treat the etcd CA as external if there is a missing etcd CA key file (etcd/ca.key) and perform the proper validation on certificates signed by the etcd CA. Additionally, make sure that the CA for all entries in the output table is included - for both certificates on disk and in kubeconfig files.

- Kubeadm: remove the "ephemeral_storage" request from the etcd static pod that kubeadm deploys on stacked etcd control plane nodes. This request has caused sporadic failures on some setups due to a problem in the kubelet with cadvisor and the LocalStorageCapacityIsolation feature gate.

- Kubeadm: when using a custom image repository for CoreDNS kubeadm now will append the `coredns` image name instead of `coredns/coredns`, thus restoring the behaviour existing before the v1.21 release. Users who rely on nested folder for the coredns image should set the `clusterConfiguration.dns.imageRepository` value including the nested path name (e.g using `registry.company.xyz/coredns` will force kubeadm to use `registry.company.xyz/coredns/coredns` image). No action is needed if using the default registry (k8s.gcr.io). ([#102502](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102502), [@ykakarap](https://github.com/ykakarap))

- The `system:aggregate-to-edit` role no longer includes write access to the Endpoints API. For new Kubernetes 1.22 clusters, the `edit` and `admin` roles will no longer include that access in newly created Kubernetes 1.22 clusters. This will have no affect on existing clusters upgrading to Kubernetes 1.22.

  were only validating the API objects, not performing any validation on the actual Services implementation.
  Those tests now validate that the Services under test are able to forward traffic to the endpoints. ([#101709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101709), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- The current behavior for Services that `IPFamilyPolicy` set as `PreferDualstack`. The current behavior when the cluster is upgraded to dual-stack is:
  - Services that have been set to IPFamilyPolicy = PreferDualstack will be upgraded when the service object is updated. e.g., when a user change a label.
  
  This behavior will change to:
  - Services that have been set  IPFamilyPolicy = PreferDualstack will not be upgraded when the service object is updated. User can still change policy, type etc and existing behaviors remain the same.

- The kube-proxy sync_proxy_rules_iptables_total metric now gives
  the correct number of rules, rather than being off by one.
  
  Fixed multiple iptables proxy regressions introduced in 1.22:
  
    - When using Services with SessionAffinity, client affinity for an
      endpoint now gets broken when that endpoint becomes non-ready
      (rather than continuing until the endpoint is fully deleted).
  
    - Traffic to a service IP now starts getting rejected (as opposed to
      merely dropped) as soon as there are no longer any *usable*
      endpoints, rather than waiting until all of the terminating
      endpoints have terminated even when those terminating endpoints
      were not being used.
  
    - Chains for endpoints that won't be used are no longer output to
      iptables, saving a bit of memory/time/cpu. ([#106373](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106373), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network]
