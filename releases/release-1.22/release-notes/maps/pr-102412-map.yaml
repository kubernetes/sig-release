  text: Remove support for the Service `topologyKeys` field (alpha) and the `kube-proxy`
    implementation of it. This field was deprecated several cycles ago. This functionality
    is replaced by the combination of automatic topology hints per-endpoint (alpha)
    and the Service `internalTrafficPolicy` field (alpha).
