    Introduce a feature gate `DisableCloudProviders` allowing to disable cloud-provider initialization in KAPI, KCM and kubelet.
    `DisableCloudProviders` FeatureGate is currently in Alpha, which means is currently disabled by default. Once the FeatureGate moves to beta, in-tree cloud providers would be disabled by default, and a user won't be able to specify `--cloud-provider=<aws|openstack|azure|gcp|vsphere>` anymore to any of KCM, KAPI or kubelet. Only a '--cloud-provider=external' would be allowed. CCM would have to run out-of-tree with CSI.
