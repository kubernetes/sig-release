    Added field `.status.uncountedTerminatedPods` to the Job resource. This field is used by the job controller to keep track of finished pods before adding them to the Job status counters. Pods created by the job controller get the finalizer `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`
    Jobs that are tracked using this mechanism get the annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`. This is a temporary measure. Two releases after this feature graduates to beta, the annotation won't be added to Jobs anymore.
