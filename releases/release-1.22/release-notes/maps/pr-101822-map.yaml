  text: A new score extension for NodeResourcesFit plugin that merges the functionality
    of `NodeResourcesLeastAllocated`, `NodeResourcesMostAllocated`, `RequestedToCapacityRatio`
    plugins, which are marked as deprecated as of v1beta2. In v1beta1, the three plugins
    can still be used in v1beta1 but not at the same time with the score extension
    of `NodeResourcesFit`.
