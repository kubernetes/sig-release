  text: The `CertificateSigningRequest.certificates.k8s.io` API supports an optional
    expirationSeconds field to allow the client to request a particular duration for
    the issued certificate.  The default signer implementations provided by the Kubernetes
    controller manager will honor this field as long as it does not exceed the --cluster-signing-duration
    flag.
