  text: "kubeadm: remove the automatic detection and matching of cgroup drivers
    for Docker. For new clusters if you have not configured the cgroup driver explicitly
    you might get a failure in the `kubelet` on driver mismatch (kubeadm clusters
    should be using the `systemd` driver). Also remove the `IsDockerSystemdCheck`
    preflight check (warning) that checks if the Docker cgroup driver is set to `systemd`.
    Ideally such detection / coordination should be on the side of CRI implementers
    and the kubelet (tracked [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99808)).
    Please see the [page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/) on how to configure cgroup drivers with kubeadm
    manually"
