  text: Scheduler's CycleState now embeds internal read/write locking inside its `Read()`
    and `Write()` functions. Meanwhile, `Lock()` and `Unlock()` function are removed. Scheduler
    plugin developers are now required to remove `CycleState#Lock()` and `CycleState#Unlock()`.
    Just simply use `Read()` and `Write()` as they're natively thread-safe now.
