  text: "A `system-cluster-critical` pod should not get a low OOM Score. \n\nAs of
    now both `system-node-critical` and `system-cluster-critical` pods have -997 OOM
    score, making them one of the last processes to be OOMKilled. By definition `system-cluster-critical`
    pods can be scheduled elsewhere if there is a resource crunch on the node where
    as `system-node-critical` pods cannot be rescheduled. This was the reason for
    `system-node-critical` to have higher priority value than `system-cluster-critical`.
    \ This change allows only `system-node-critical` priority class to have low OOMScore.\n\naction
    required\nIf the user wants to have the pod to be OOMKilled last and the pod has
    `system-cluster-critical` priority class, it has to be changed to `system-node-critical`
    priority class to preserve the existing behavior"
