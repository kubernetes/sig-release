  text: The `TerminationGracePeriodSeconds` on pod specs and container probes should
    not be negative. Negative values of `TerminationGracePeriodSeconds` will be treated
    as the value `1s` on the delete path. Immutable field validation will be relaxed
    in order to update negative values. In a future release, negative values will
    not be permitted.
