## 1.9 Release Notes

## WARNING: etcd backup strongly recommended

Before updating to 1.9, you are strongly recommended to back up your etcd data. Consult the installation procedure you are using (kargo, kops, kube-up, kube-aws, kubeadm etc) for specific advice.

Some upgrade methods might upgrade etcd from 3.0 to 3.1 automatically when you upgrade from Kubernetes 1.8, unless you specify otherwise. Because [etcd does not support downgrading](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/upgrades/upgrade_3_1.html), you'll need to either remain on etcd 3.1 or restore from a backup if you want to downgrade back to Kubernetes 1.8.

## Introduction to 1.9.0

Kubernetes version 1.9 includes new features and enhancements, as well as fixes to identified issues. The release notes contain a brief overview of the important changes introduced in this release. The content is organized by Special Interest Group ([SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md)).

For initial installations, see the [Setup topics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, first take any actions required [Before Upgrading](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.9.md#before-upgrading).

For more information about this release and for the latest documentation, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## Major themes

Kubernetes is developed by community members whose work is organized into
[Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md), which provide the themes that guide their work. For the 1.9 release, these themes included:

### API Machinery

Extensibility. SIG API Machinery added a new class of admission control webhooks (mutating), and brought the admission control webhooks to beta.

### Apps

The core workloads API, which is composed of the DaemonSet, Deployment, ReplicaSet, and StatefulSet kinds, has been promoted to GA stability in the apps/v1 group version. As such, the apps/v1beta2 group version is deprecated, and all new code should use the kinds in the apps/v1 group version. 

### Auth

SIG Auth focused on extension-related authorization improvements. Permissions can now be added to the built-in RBAC admin/edit/view roles using [cluster role aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles). [Webhook authorizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/webhook/) can now deny requests and short-circuit checking subsequent authorizers. Performance and usability of the beta [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) feature was also improved.

### AWS

In v1.9 SIG AWS has improved stability of EBS support across the board. If a Volume is “stuck” in the attaching state to a node for too long a unschedulable taint will be applied to the node, so a Kubernetes admin can [take manual steps to correct the error](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html). Users are encouraged to ensure they are monitoring for the taint, and should consider automatically terminating instances in this state.

In addition, support for NVMe disks has been added to Kubernetes, and a service of type LoadBalancer can now be backed with an NLB instead of an ELB (alpha).

### Azure

SIG Azure worked on improvements in the cloud provider, including significant work on the Azure Load Balancer implementation.

### Cluster Lifecycle

SIG Cluster Lifecycle has been focusing on improving kubeadm in order to bring it to GA in a future release, as well as developing the [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/tree/master/cluster-api). For kubeadm, most new features, such as support for CoreDNS, IPv6 and Dynamic Kubelet Configuration, have gone in as alpha features. We expect to graduate these features to beta and beyond in the next release. The initial Cluster API spec and GCE sample implementation were developed from scratch during this cycle, and we look forward to stabilizing them into something production-grade during 2018.

### Instrumentation

In v1.9 we focused on improving stability of the components owned by the SIG, including Heapster, Custom Metrics API adapters for Prometheus, and Stackdriver.

### Network

In v1.9 SIG Network has implemented alpha support for IPv6, and alpha support for CoreDNS as a drop-in replacement for kube-dns. Additionally, SIG Network has begun the deprecation process for the extensions/v1beta1 NetworkPolicy API in favor of the networking.k8s.io/v1 equivalent.

### Node

SIG Node iterated on the ability to support more workloads with better performance and improved reliability.  Alpha features were improved around hardware accelerator support, device plugins enablement, and cpu pinning policies to enable us to graduate these features to beta in a future release.  In addition, a number of reliability and performance enhancements were made across the node to help operators in production. 

### OpenStack

In this cycle, SIG OpenStack focused on configuration simplification through smarter defaults and the use of auto-detection wherever feasible (Block Storage API versions, Security Groups) as well as updating API support, including:

*   Block Storage (Cinder) V3 is now supported.
*   Load Balancer (Octavia) V2 is now supported, in addition to Neutron LBaaS V2.
*   Neutron LBaas V1 support has been removed.

This work enables Kubernetes to take full advantage of the relevant services as exposed by OpenStack clouds. Refer to the [Cloud Providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#openstack) documentation for more information.

### Storage

[SIG Storage](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage) is responsible for storage and volume plugin components.

For the 1.9 release, SIG Storage made Kubernetes more pluggable and modular by introducing an alpha implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI). CSI will make installing new volume plugins as easy as deploying a pod, and enable third-party storage providers to develop their plugins without the need to add code to the core Kubernetes codebase.

The SIG also focused on adding functionality to the Kubernetes volume subsystem, such as alpha support for exposing volumes as block devices inside containers, extending the alpha volume-resizing support to more volume plugins, and topology-aware volume scheduling.

### Windows

We are advancing support for Windows Server and Windows Server Containers to beta along with continued feature and functional advancements on both the Kubernetes and Windows platforms. This opens the door for many Windows-specific applications and workloads to run on Kubernetes, significantly expanding the implementation scenarios and the enterprise reach of Kubernetes.

## Before Upgrading 

Consider the following changes, limitations, and guidelines before you upgrade:

### **API Machinery**

*   The admission API, which is used when the API server calls admission control webhooks, is moved from `admission.v1alpha1` to `admission.v1beta1`. You must **delete any existing webhooks before you upgrade** your cluster, and update them to use the latest API. This change is not backward compatible.
*   The admission webhook configurations API, part of the admissionregistration API, is now at v1beta1. Delete any existing webhook configurations before you upgrade, and update your configuration files to use the latest API. For this and the previous change, see also [the documentation]([https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/extensible-admission-controllers/#external-admission-webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/extensible-admission-controllers/#external-admission-webhooks)).
*   A new `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` is added (replacing `GenericAdmissionWebhook`) and is available in the generic API server. You must update your API server configuration file to pass the webhook to the `--admission-control` flag. ([#55988](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55988),[ @caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))  ([#54513](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54513),[ @deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
*   The deprecated options `--portal-net` and `--service-node-ports` for the API server are removed. ([#52547](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52547),[ @xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))

### **Auth**

*   PodSecurityPolicy: A compatibility issue with the allowPrivilegeEscalation field that caused policies to start denying pods they previously allowed was fixed. If you defined PodSecurityPolicy objects using a 1.8.0 client or server and set allowPrivilegeEscalation to false, these objects must be reapplied after you upgrade. ([#53443](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53443),[ @liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
*   KMS: Alpha integration with GCP KMS was removed in favor of a future out-of-process extension point. Discontinue use of the GCP KMS integration and ensure [data has been decrypted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#decrypting-all-data) (or reencrypted with a different provider) before upgrading ([#54759](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54759),[ @sakshamsharma](https://github.com/sakshamsharma))

### **CLI**

*   Swagger 1.2 validation is removed for kubectl. The options `--use-openapi` and `--schema-cache-dir` are also removed because they are no longer needed. ([#53232](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53232),[ @apelisse](https://github.com/apelisse))

### **Cluster Lifecycle**

*   You must either specify the `--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash` flag to `kubeadm join`, or opt out of the CA pinning feature using `--discovery-token-unsafe-skip-ca-verification`.
*   The default `auto-detect` behavior of the kubelet's `--cloud-provider` flag is removed.
    *   You can manually set `--cloud-provider=auto-detect`, but be aware that this behavior will be removed completely in a future version.
    *   Best practice for version 1.9 and future versions is to explicitly set a cloud-provider. See [the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/scratch/#cloud-providers)
*   The kubeadm `--skip-preflight-checks` flag is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
*   If you are using the cloud provider API to determine the external host address of the apiserver, set `--external-hostname` explicitly instead. The cloud provider detection has been deprecated and will be removed in the future ([#54516](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54516),[ @dims](https://github.com/dims))

### **Multicluster**

*   Development of Kubernetes Federation has moved to [github.com/kubernetes/federation](github.com/kubernetes/federation). This move out of tree also means that Federation will begin releasing separately from Kubernetes. Impact: 
    *   Federation-specific behavior will no longer be included in kubectl
    *   kubefed will no longer be released as part of Kubernetes
    *   The Federation servers will no longer be included in the hyperkube binary and image. ([#53816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53816),[ @marun](https://github.com/marun))

### **Node**

*   The kubelet `--network-plugin-dir` flag is removed. This flag was deprecated in version 1.7, and is replaced with `--cni-bin-dir`. ([#53564](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53564),[ @supereagle](https://github.com/supereagle))
*   kubelet's `--cloud-provider` flag no longer defaults to "auto-detect". If you want cloud-provider support in kubelet, you must set a specific cloud-provider explicitly. ([#53573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53573),[ @dims](https://github.com/dims))

### **Network**

*   NetworkPolicy objects are now stored in etcd in v1 format. After you upgrade to version 1.9, make sure that all NetworkPolicy objects are migrated to v1. ([#51955](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51955), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))
*   The API group/version for the kube-proxy configuration has changed from `componentconfig/v1alpha1` to `kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1`. If you are using a config file for kube-proxy instead of the command line flags, you must change its apiVersion to `kubeproxy.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1`. ([#53645](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53645), [@xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))
*   The "ServiceNodeExclusion" feature gate must now be enabled for the `alpha.service-controller.kubernetes.io/exclude-balancer` annotation on nodes to be honored. ([#54644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54644),[ @brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))

### **Scheduling**

*   Taint key `unreachable` is now in GA.
*   Taint key `notReady` is changed to `not-ready`, and is also now in GA.
*   These changes are automatically updated for taints. Tolerations for these taints must be updated manually. Specifically, you must:
    *   Change `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady` to `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`
    *   Change `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable` to  `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`
*   The `node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure` taint now respects the configured whitelist.  To use it, you must add it to the whitelist.([#55251](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55251),[ @deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
*   Refactor kube-scheduler configuration ([#52428](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52428))
    *   The kube-scheduler command now supports a --config flag which is the location of a file containing a serialized scheduler configuration. Most other kube-scheduler flags are now deprecated. ([#52562](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52562),[ @ironcladlou](https://github.com/ironcladlou))
*   Opaque integer resources (OIR), which were (deprecated in v1.8.), have been removed. ([#55103](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55103),[ @ConnorDoyle](https://github.com/ConnorDoyle))

### **Storage**

*   [alpha] The LocalPersistentVolumes alpha feature now also requires the VolumeScheduling alpha feature.  This is a breaking change, and the following changes are required: 
    *   The VolumeScheduling feature gate must also be enabled on kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager components.
    *   The NoVolumeNodeConflict predicate has been removed.  For non-default schedulers, update your scheduler policy.
    *   The CheckVolumeBinding predicate must be enabled in non-default schedulers. ([#55039](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55039),[ @msau42](https://github.com/msau42))

### **OpenStack**

*   Remove the LbaasV1 of OpenStack cloud provider, currently only support LbaasV2. ([#52717](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52717),[ @FengyunPan](https://github.com/FengyunPan))

## Known Issues

This section contains a list of known issues reported in Kubernetes 1.9 release. The content is populated from the [v1.9.x known issues and FAQ accumulator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57159](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57159).

*   If you are adding Windows Server Virtual Machines as nodes to your Kubernetes environment, there is a compatibility issue with certain virtualization products. Specifically the Windows version of the kubelet.exe calls `GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory` to get the physical memory installed on Windows machines and reports it as part of node metrics to heapster. This API call fails for VMware and VirtualBox virtualization environments. This issue is not present in bare metal Windows deployments, in Hyper-V, or on some of the popular public cloud providers.

*   If you run `kubectl get po` while the API server in unreachable, a misleading error is returned: `the server doesn't have a resource type "po"`. To work around this issue, specify the full resource name in the command instead of the abbreviation: `kubectl get pods`. This issue will be fixed in a future release.

  For more information, see [#57198](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57198).

*   Mutating and validating webhook configurations are continuously polled by the API server (once per second). This issue will be fixed in a future release.

  For more information, see [#56357](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56357).

*   Audit logging is slow because writes to the log are performed synchronously with requests to the log. This issue will be fixed in a future release.

  For more information, see [#53006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53006).

*   Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are not properly deleted under certain conditions. This issue will be fixed in a future release.

  For more information, see [#56348](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56348).

*   API server times out after performing a rolling update of the etcd cluster. This issue will be fixed in a future release.

  For more information, see [#47131](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47131)

*   If a namespaced resource is owned by a cluster scoped resource, and the namespaced dependent is processed before the cluster scoped owner has ever been observed by the garbage collector, the dependent will be erroneously deleted.

  For more information, see [#54940](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54940)

## Deprecations

This section provides an overview of deprecated API versions, options, flags, and arguments. Deprecated means that we intend to remove the capability from a future release. After removal, the capability will no longer work. The sections are organized by SIGs.

### **API Machinery**

*   The kube-apiserver `--etcd-quorum-read` flag is deprecated and the ability to switch off quorum read will be removed in a future release. ([#53795](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53795),[ @xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))
*   The `/ui` redirect in kube-apiserver is deprecated and will be removed in Kubernetes 1.10. ([#53046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53046), [@maciaszczykm](https://github.com/maciaszczykm))
*   `etcd2` as a backend is deprecated and support will be removed in Kubernetes 1.13 or 1.14.

### **Auth**

*   Default controller-manager options for `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file` are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. ([#54495](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54495),[ @mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))
*   RBAC objects are now stored in etcd in v1 format. After upgrading to 1.9, ensure all RBAC objects (Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings) are at v1. v1alpha1 support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. ([#52950](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52950),[ @liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### **Cluster Lifecycle**

*   kube-apiserver: `--ssh-user` and `--ssh-keyfile` are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Users of SSH tunnel functionality in Google Container Engine for the Master -> Cluster communication should plan alternate methods for bridging master and node networks. ([#54433](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54433),[ @dims](https://github.com/dims))
*   The kubeadm `--skip-preflight-checks` flag is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
*   If you are using the cloud provider API to determine the external host address of the apiserver, set `--external-hostname` explicitly instead. The cloud provider detection has been deprecated and will be removed in the future ([#54516](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54516),[ @dims](https://github.com/dims))

### **Network**

*   The NetworkPolicy extensions/v1beta1 API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This functionality has been migrated to a dedicated v1 API - networking.k8s.io/v1. v1beta1 Network Policies can be upgraded to the v1 API with the [cluster/update-storage-objects.sh script](https://github.com/danwinship/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/update-storage-objects.sh). Documentation can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). ([#56425](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56425), [@cmluciano](https://github.com/cmluciano))

### **Storage**

*   The `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation is deprecated. It will be removed in a future release. For the StorageClass API object, use v1, and in place of the annotation use `v1.PersistentVolumeClaim.Spec.StorageClassName` and `v1.PersistentVolume.Spec.StorageClassName` instead. ([#53580](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53580),[ @xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))

### **Scheduling**

*   The kube-scheduler command now supports a `--config` flag, which is the location of a file containing a serialized scheduler configuration. Most other kube-scheduler flags are now deprecated. ([#52562](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52562),[ @ironcladlou](https://github.com/ironcladlou))

### **Node**

*   The kubelet's `--enable-custom-metrics` flag is now deprecated. ([#54154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54154),[ @mtaufen](https://github.com/mtaufen))

## Notable Changes

### **Workloads API (apps/v1)**

As announced with the release of version 1.8, the Kubernetes Workloads API is at v1 in version 1.9. This API consists of the DaemonSet, Deployment, ReplicaSet and StatefulSet kinds.

### **API Machinery**

#### **Admission Control**

*   Admission webhooks are now in beta, and include the following:
    *   Mutation support for admission webhooks. ([#54892](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54892),[ @caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
    *   Webhook admission now takes a config file that describes how to authenticate to webhook servers ([#54414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54414),[ @deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
    *   The dynamic admission webhook now supports a URL in addition to a service reference, to accommodate out-of-cluster webhooks. ([#54889](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54889),[ @lavalamp](https://github.com/lavalamp))
    *   Added `namespaceSelector` to `externalAdmissionWebhook` configuration to allow applying webhooks only to objects in the namespaces that have matching labels. ([#54727](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54727),[ @caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
*   Metrics are added for monitoring admission plugins, including the new dynamic (webhook-based) ones. ([#55183](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55183),[ @jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz))
*   The PodSecurityPolicy annotation kubernetes.io/psp on pods is set only once on create. ([#55486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55486),[ @sttts](https://github.com/sttts))

#### **API & API server**

*   Fixed a bug related to discovery information for scale subresources in the apps API group ([#54683](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54683),[ @liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
*   Fixed a bug that prevented client-go metrics from being registered in Prometheus. This bug affected multiple components. ([#53434](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53434),[ @crassirostris](https://github.com/crassirostris))

#### **Audit**

*   Fixed a bug so that `kube-apiserver` now waits for open connections to finish before exiting. This fix provides graceful shutdown and ensures that the audit backend no longer drops events on shutdown. ([#53695](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53695),[ @hzxuzhonghu](https://github.com/hzxuzhonghu))
*   Webhooks now always retry sending if a connection reset error is returned. ([#53947](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53947),[ @crassirostris](https://github.com/crassirostris))

#### **Custom Resources**

*   Validation of resources defined by a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is now in beta ([#54647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54647),[ @colemickens](https://github.com/colemickens))
*   An example CRD controller has been added, at [github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller](github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller). ([#52753](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52753),[ @munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz))
*   Custom resources served by CustomResourceDefinition objects now support field selectors for `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace`. Also fixed an issue with watching a single object; earlier versions could watch only a collection, and so a watch on an instance would fail.  ([#53345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53345),[ @ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))

#### **Other**

*   `kube-apiserver` now runs with the default value for `service-cluster-ip-range` ([#52870](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52870),[ @jennybuckley](https://github.com/jennybuckley))
*   Add `--etcd-compaction-interval` to apiserver for controlling request of compaction to etcd3 from apiserver. ([#51765](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51765),[ @mitake](https://github.com/mitake))
*   The httpstream/spdy calls now support CIDR notation for NO_PROXY ([#54413](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54413),[ @kad](https://github.com/kad))
*   Code generation for CRD and User API server types is improved with the addition of two new scripts to k8s.io/code-generator: `generate-groups.sh` and `generate-internal-groups.sh`. ([#52186](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52186),[ @sttts](https://github.com/sttts))
*   [beta] Flag `--chunk-size={SIZE}` is added to `kubectl get` to customize the number of results returned in large lists of resources. This reduces the perceived latency of managing large clusters because the server returns the first set of results to the client much more quickly. Pass 0 to disable this feature.([#53768](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53768),[ @smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
*   [beta] API chunking via the limit and continue request parameters is promoted to beta in this release. Client libraries using the Informer or ListWatch types will automatically opt in to chunking. ([#52949](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52949),[ @smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
*   The `--etcd-quorum-read` flag now defaults to true to ensure correct operation with HA etcd clusters. This flag is deprecated and the flag will be removed in future versions, as well as the ability to turn off this functionality. ([#53717](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53717),[ @liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
*   Add events.k8s.io api group with v1beta1 API containing redesigned event type. ([#49112](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/49112),[ @gmarek](https://github.com/gmarek))
*   Fixed a bug where API discovery failures were crashing the kube controller manager via the garbage collector. ([#55259](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55259),[ @ironcladlou](https://github.com/ironcladlou))
*   `conversion-gen` is now usable in a context without a vendored k8s.io/kubernetes. The Kubernetes core API is removed from `default extra-peer-dirs`. ([#54394](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54394),[ @sttts](https://github.com/sttts))
*   Fixed a bug where the `client-gen` tag for code-generator required a newline between a comment block and a statement.  tag shortcomings when newline is omitted ([#53893](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53893)) ([#55233](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55233),[ @sttts](https://github.com/sttts))
*   The Apiserver proxy now rewrites the URL when a service returns an absolute path with the request's host. ([#52556](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52556),[ @roycaihw](https://github.com/roycaihw))
*   The gRPC library is updated to pick up data race fix ([#53124](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53124)) ([#53128](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53128),[ @dixudx](https://github.com/dixudx))
*   Fixed server name verification of aggregated API servers and webhook admission endpoints ([#56415](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/56415),[ @liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

### **Apps**

*   The `kubernetes.io/created-by` annotation is no longer added to controller-created objects. Use the `metadata.ownerReferences` item with controller set to `true` to determine which controller, if any, owns an object. ([#54445](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54445),[ @crimsonfaith91](https://github.com/crimsonfaith91))
*   StatefulSet controller now creates a label for each Pod in a StatefulSet. The label is `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name`, where `pod-name` = the name of the Pod. This allows users to create a Service per Pod to expose a connection to individual Pods. ([#55329](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55329),[ @kow3ns](https://github.com/kow3ns))
*   DaemonSet status includes a new field named `conditions`, making it consistent with other workloads controllers. ([#55272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55272),[ @janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))

([#55148](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55148),[ @dixudx](https://github.com/dixudx))
    *   Clients using older endpoints will be unaffected. This change is only at the REST API level and is independent of the default behavior of particular clients (e.g. this does not affect the default for the kubectl `--cascade` flag).
    *   If you upgrade your client-go libs and use the `AppsV1()` interface, please note that the default garbage collection behavior is changed.

### **Auth**

### **Cluster Lifecycle**

#### **API Server**

*   [alpha] Added an `--endpoint-reconciler-type` command-line argument to select the endpoint reconciler to use. The default is to use the 'master-count' reconciler which is the default for 1.9 and in use prior to 1.9. The 'lease' reconciler stores endpoints within the storage api for better cleanup of deleted (or removed) API servers. The 'none' reconciler is a no-op reconciler, which can be used in self-hosted environments.   ([#51698](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51698), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips))

#### **Cloud Provider Integration**

*   Added `cloud-controller-manager` to `hyperkube`. This is useful as a number of deployment tools run all of the kubernetes components from the `hyperkube `image/binary. It also makes testing easier as a single binary/image can be built and pushed quickly.  ([#54197](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54197),[ @colemickens](https://github.com/colemickens))

### **Instrumentation**

#### **Audit**

*   Adjust batching audit webhook default parameters: increase queue size, batch size, and initial backoff. Add throttling to the batching audit webhook. Default rate limit is 10 QPS. ([#53417](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53417),[ @crassirostris](https://github.com/crassirostris))

*   The EvictionHard, EvictionSoft, EvictionSoftGracePeriod, EvictionMinimumReclaim, SystemReserved, and KubeReserved fields in the KubeletConfiguration object (`kubeletconfig/v1alpha1`) are now of type map[string]string, which facilitates writing JSON and YAML files. ([#54823](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54823),[ @mtaufen](https://github.com/mtaufen))
*   Relative paths in the Kubelet's local config files (`--init-config-dir`) will now be resolved relative to the location of the containing files. ([#55648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55648),[ @mtaufen](https://github.com/mtaufen))
*   It is now possible to set multiple manifest URL headers with the kubelet's `--manifest-url-header` flag. Multiple headers for the same key will be added in the order provided. The ManifestURLHeader field in KubeletConfiguration object (kubeletconfig/v1alpha1) is now a map[string][]string, which facilitates writing JSON and YAML files.

    *   Kubernetes will now automatically determine the security group for the node
    *   Nodes can now belong to multiple security groups

### **Scheduling**

#### **Hardware Accelerators**

*   Add ExtendedResourceToleration admission controller. This facilitates creation of dedicated nodes with extended resources. If operators want to create dedicated nodes with extended resources (such as GPUs, FPGAs, and so on), they are expected to taint the node with extended resource name as the key. This admission controller, if enabled, automatically adds tolerations for such taints to pods requesting extended resources, so users don't have to manually add these tolerations. ([#55839](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55839),[ @mindprince](https://github.com/mindprince))

#### **Other**

*   Object count quotas supported on all standard resources using count/<resource>.<group> syntax ([#54320](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54320),[ @derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))
*   Apply algorithm in scheduler by feature gates. ([#52723](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/52723),[ @k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))
*   A new priority function ResourceLimitsPriorityMap (disabled by default and behind alpha feature gate and not part of the scheduler's default priority functions list) that assigns a lowest possible score of 1 to a node that satisfies one or both of input pod's cpu and memory limits, mainly to break ties between nodes with same scores. ([#55906](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55906),[ @aveshagarwal](https://github.com/aveshagarwal))
*   Kubelet evictions now take pod priority into account ([#53542](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/53542),[ @dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole))
*   PodTolerationRestriction admisson plugin: if namespace level tolerations are empty, now they override cluster level tolerations. ([#54812](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54812),[ @aveshagarwal](https://github.com/aveshagarwal))

*   [alpha] Containerized mount utilities
    *   Allow mount utilities, used to mount volumes, to run inside a container instead of on the host.
*   Bug Fixes
    *   ScaleIO volume plugin is no longer dependent on the drv_cfg binary, so a Kubernetes cluster can easily run a containerized kubelet. ([#54956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/54956),[ @vladimirvivien](https://github.com/vladimirvivien))
    *   AWS EBS Volumes are detached from stopped AWS nodes. ([#55893](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55893),[ @gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
    *   AWS EBS volumes are detached if attached to a different node than expected. ([#55491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55491),[ @gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
