  text: 'kubeadm: deprecate the feature `--experimental-kustomize` in favor of `--experimental-patches`.
    The supported patch formats are the same as "kubectl patch". They are read as
    files from a directory and can be applied to kubeadm components during init/join/upgrade.
    Only patching of static Pods is supported for the time being.'
