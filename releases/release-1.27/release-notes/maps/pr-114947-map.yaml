  text: support for the alpha seccomp annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod`
    and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` were deprecated since v1.19,
    now have been completely removed. The seccomp fields are no longer auto-populated
    when pods with seccomp annotations are created. Pods should use the corresponding
    pod or container `securityContext.seccompProfile` field instead.
