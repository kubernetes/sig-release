  text: Since Kubernetes v1.5, `kubectl apply` has had an alpha-stage `--prune` flag
    to support deleting previously applied objects that have been removed from the
    input manifest. This feature has remained in alpha ever since due to performance
    and correctness issues inherent in its design. This PR exposes a second, independent
    pruning alpha powered by a new standard named `ApplySets`. An `ApplySet` is a
    server-side object (by default, a Secret; ConfigMaps are also allowed) that kubectl
    can use to accurately and efficiently track set membership across `apply` operations.
    The format used for `ApplySet` is set out in  [KEP 3659](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3659)
    as a low-level specification.  Other tools in the ecosystem can also build on
    this specification for improved interoperability.  To try the ApplySet-based pruning
    alpha, set `KUBECTL_APPLYSET=true` and use the flags `--prune --applyset=secret-name`
    with `kubectl apply`.
