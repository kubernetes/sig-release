    Expanded the partial fix for https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/111539
    which was already started in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109706
    Specifically, we will now reduce the amount of syncs for `ETP=local` services even
    further in the CCM and avoid re-configuring LBs to an even greater extent.
