    Added new option to the `InterPodAffinity` scheduler plugin to ignore existing
    pods` preferred inter-pod affinities if the incoming pod has no preferred inter-pod
    affinities. This option can be used as an optimization for higher scheduling throughput
    (at the cost of an occasional pod being scheduled non-optimally/violating existing
    pods preferred inter-pod affinities). To enable this scheduler option, set the
    `InterPodAffinity` scheduler plugin arg `ignorePreferredTermsOfExistingPods: true`
