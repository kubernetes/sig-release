    Fixed two regressions introduced by the `PodDisruptionConditions` feature (on by default in 1.26):
    - pod eviction API calls returned spurious precondition errors and required a second evict API call to succeed
    - dry-run eviction API calls persisted a DisruptionTarget condition into the pod being evicted
