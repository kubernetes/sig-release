    `StatefulSet` names must be DNS labels, rather than subdomains. Any `StatefulSet`
    which took advantage of subdomain validation (by having dots in the name) can't
    possibly have worked, because we eventually set `pod.spec.hostname` from the `StatefulSetName`,
    and that is validated as a DNS label.
