  text: Fixed file permission issues that happened during update of `Secret`/`ConfigMap`/`projected
    volume` when `fsGroup` is used. The problem caused a race condition where application
    gets intermittent permission denied error when reading files that were just updated,
    before the correct permissions were applied.
