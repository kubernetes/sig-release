    Kubelet TCP and HTTP probes are now more effective using networking resources:
    conntrack entries, sockets. This is achieved by reducing the `TIME-WAIT` state
    of the connection to 1 second, instead of the defaults 60 seconds. This allows
    kubelet to free the socket, and free conntrack entry and ephemeral port associated.
