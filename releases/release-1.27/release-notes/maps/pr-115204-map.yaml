  text: '[KCCM - service controller]: enabled connection draining for terminating
    pods upon node downscale by the cluster autoscaler. This is done by not reacting
    to the taint used by the cluster autoscaler to indicate that the node is going
    away soon, thus keeping the node referenced by the load balancer until the VM
    has been completely deleted.'
