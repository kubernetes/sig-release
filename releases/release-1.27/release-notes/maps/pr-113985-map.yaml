  text: Shared informers now correctly propagate whether they are synced or not. Individual
    informer handlers may now check if they are synced or not (new `HasSynced` method).
    Library support is added to assist controllers in tracking whether their own work
    is completed for items in the initial list (`AsyncTracker`).
