    `resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1` was replaced with `resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2`. Before
    upgrading a cluster, all objects in resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 (ResourceClaim, ResourceClaimTemplate,
    ResourceClass, PodScheduling) must be deleted. The changes are internal, so
    YAML files which create pods and resource claims don't need changes except for
    the newer `apiVersion`.
