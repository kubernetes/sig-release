## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- FailCgroupV1 will be set to true from 1.35. 
  This means that nodes will not start on a cgroup v1 in our default behavior. 
  This is putting cgroup v1 into a deprecated state. ([#134298](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134298), [@kannon92](https://github.com/kannon92)) [SIG Node]
- Mark ipvs mode in kube-proxy as deprecated. ipvs mode in kube-proxy is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Kubernetes. Users are encouraged to move to nftables. ([#134539](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134539), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Network]

### API Change

- Added `WithOrigin` within `apis/core/validation` with adjusted tests. ([#132825](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132825), [@PatrickLaabs](https://github.com/PatrickLaabs))
- Added validation to ensure `log-flush-frequency` is a positive value, returning an error instead of causing a panic. ([#133540](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133540), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG Architecture, Instrumentation, Network and Node]
- Enabled `kubectl get -o kyaml` by default. To disable it, set `KUBECTL_KYAML=false`. ([#133327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133327), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Feature gate dependencies are now explicit, and validated at startup. A feature can no longer be enabled if it depends on a disabled feature. In particular, this means that `AllAlpha=true` will no longer work without enabling disabled-by-default beta features that are depended on (either with `AllBeta=true` or explicitly enumerating the disabled dependencies). ([#133697](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133697), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- Generated OpenAPI model packages for API types into `zz_generated.model_name.go` files, accessible via the `OpenAPIModelName()` function. This allows API authors to declare desired OpenAPI model packages instead of relying on the Go package path of API types. ([#131755](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131755), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Introduced a new declarative validation tag `+k8s:customUnique` to control listmap uniqueness. ([#134279](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134279), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kube-apiserver: Fixed a `v1.34` regression in `CustomResourceDefinition` handling that incorrectly warned about unrecognized formats on number and integer properties. ([#133896](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133896), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Contributor Experience, Network, Node and Scheduling]
- Kube-apiserver: fix a possible panic validating a custom resource whose CustomResourceDefinition indicates a status subresource exists, but which does not define a `status` property in the `openAPIV3Schema` ([#133721](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133721), [@fusida](https://github.com/fusida)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kubernetes API Go types removed runtime use of the github.com/gogo/protobuf library, and are no longer registered into the global gogo type registry. Kubernetes API Go types were not suitable for use with the google.golang.org/protobuf library, and no longer implement `ProtoMessage()` by default to avoid accidental incompatible use. If removal of these marker methods impacts your use, it can be re-enabled for one more release with a `kubernetes_protomessage_one_more_release` build tag, but will be removed in 1.36. ([#134256](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134256), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Promoted HPA configurable tolerance to beta. The `HPAConfigurableTolerance` feature gate is now enabled by default. ([#133128](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133128), [@jm-franc](https://github.com/jm-franc)) [SIG API Machinery and Autoscaling]
- The MaxUnavailableStatefulSet feature is now beta and enabled by default. ([#133153](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133153), [@helayoty](https://github.com/helayoty)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Updated storage version for `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` to `v1beta1`. ([#133715](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133715), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd and Testing]
- Upgraded the `PodObservedGenerationTracking` feature to beta in `v1.34` and removed the alpha version description from the OpenAPI specification. ([#133883](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133883), [@yangjunmyfm192085](https://github.com/yangjunmyfm192085))

- Added paths section to scheduler `statusz` endpoint. ([#132606](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132606), [@Peac36](https://github.com/Peac36)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Added remote runtime and image `Close()` method to be able to close the connection. ([#133211](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133211), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG Node]
- Added support for validating UUID format. ([#133948](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133948), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375))
- Added the `-n` flag as a shorthand for `--namespace` in the `kubectl config set-context` command. ([#134384](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134384), [@tchap](https://github.com/tchap)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Changed `WaitForNamedCacheSync` to `WaitForNamedCacheSyncWithContext`. ([#133904](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133904), [@aditigupta96](https://github.com/aditigupta96)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Network]
- DRA: the resource.k8s.io API now uses the v1 API version (introduced in 1.34) as default storage version. Downgrading to 1.33 is not supported. ([#133876](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133876), [@kei01234kei](https://github.com/kei01234kei)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd and Testing]
- Enable the feature gate `ContainerRestartRules` by default. The ContainerRestartRules feature is promoted to beta. Fixing a bug in this feature that caused probes continue to run even if the container has terminated and is not restartable. ([#134631](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134631), [@yuanwang04](https://github.com/yuanwang04)) [SIG Node]
- Introduced end-to-end tests to verify component invariant metrics across the entire test suite. ([#133394](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133394), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder))
- K8s.io/apimachinery: Introduced a helper function to compare `resourceVersion` strings between two objects of the same resource. ([#134330](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134330), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: the subresources `pods/exec`, `pods/attach`, and `pods/portforward` now require `create` permission for both SPDY and Websocket API requests. Previously, SPDY requests required `create` permission, but Websocket requests only required `get` permission. This change is gated by the `AuthorizePodWebsocketUpgradeCreatePermission` feature-gate, which is enabled by default.
  
  Before upgrading to 1.35, ensure any custom ClusterRoles and Roles intended to grant `pods/exec`, `pods/attach`, or `pods/portforward` permission include the `create` verb. ([#134577](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134577), [@seans3](https://github.com/seans3)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Kubeadm: Graduated the kubeadm-specific feature gate `ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode` to GA and locked it to enabled by default. To opt out, patch the `server` field in `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. Deprecated the subphase of `kubeadm join phase control-plane-join` called `etcd`, which is now hidden and replaced by subphase with identical functionality `etcd-join`. The `etcd` subphase will be removed in a future release. The subphase `kubelet-wait-bootstrap` of `kubeadm join` is no longer experimental and will now always run. ([#134106](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134106), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: print the errors during retires related to the WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents functionality at verbosity level 5. ([#134433](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134433), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubernetes is now built using Go 1.25.1 ([#134095](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134095), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built using Go 1.25.3 ([#134611](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134611), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Architecture, Cloud Provider, Etcd, Release, Storage and Testing]
- Kubernetes now uses Go Language Version 1.25, including https://go.dev/blog/container-aware-gomaxprocs ([#134120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134120), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling and Storage]
- Locked down the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate. ([#133792](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133792), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Locked the (generally available) feature gate `ExecProbeTimeout` to true. ([#134635](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134635), [@vivzbansal](https://github.com/vivzbansal)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Metrics: Excluded `dryRun` requests from `apiserver_request_sli_duration_seconds`. ([#131092](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131092), [@aldudko](https://github.com/aldudko)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Migrated validation in `resource.k8s.io` to declarative validation.
  When the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate is enabled, mismatches with existing validation are reported via metrics.
  when `DeclarativeValidationTakeover` feature gate is enabled, declarative validation becomes the primary source of errors for migrated fields. ([#134072](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134072), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Auth]
- Promoted the `HostnameOverride` feature gate to beta and is enabled by default. ([#134729](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134729), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Network and Node]
- Updated `applyconfiguration-gen` to generate extract functions for all subresources. ([#132665](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132665), [@mrIncompetent](https://github.com/mrIncompetent))
- Updated `applyconfiguration-gen` to preserve struct and field comments from source types in the generated code. ([#132663](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132663), [@mrIncompetent](https://github.com/mrIncompetent))
- Updated `kubectl describe pods` to include the involved object’s `fieldPath` (e.g., container name) in event messages, providing better context for debugging multi-container Pods. Note: This changes the previous message format for events that include a `fieldPath`. ([#133627](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133627), [@itzPranshul](https://github.com/itzPranshul))
- Updated sandbox ordering to use by attempt count or creation time. ([#130551](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/130551), [@yylt](https://github.com/yylt))

### Documentation

- Kubectl describe, get, drain and events have the ability to set chunk-size using --chunk-size flag, which is now officially stable. ([#134481](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134481), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG CLI]

- DRA Device Taints: tolerating a NoExecute did not work because the scheduler did not inform the eviction controller about the toleration, so the scheduled pod got evicted almost immediately. ([#134479](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134479), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Deprecated metrics will be hidden as per the metrics deprecation policy. https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/#deprecating-a-metric . ([#133436](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133436), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG Architecture, Instrumentation and Network]
- Disabled the `SchedulerAsyncAPICalls` feature gate to mitigate a bug where its interaction with asynchronous preemption could degrade `kube-scheduler` performance, especially under high `kube-apiserver` load. ([#134400](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134400), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko))

- Fixed a bug in `kube-proxy` `nftables` mode (GA as of `v1.33`) which fails to determine if traffic originates from a local source on the node. The issue was caused by using the wrong meta `iif` instead of `iifname` for name based matches. ([#134024](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134024), [@jack4it](https://github.com/jack4it))
- Fixed a bug in `kube-scheduler` where pending pod preemption caused preemptor pods to be retried more frequently. ([#134245](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134245), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Fixed a bug that caused apiservers to send an inappropriate Content-Type request header to authorization, token authentication, imagepolicy admission, and audit webhooks when the alpha client-go feature gate "ClientsPreferCBOR" is enabled.

- Kubeadm: Ensured waiting for `apiserver` uses a local client that doesn't reach to the control plane endpoint and instead reaches directly to the local API server endpoint. ([#134265](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134265), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Fixed `KUBEADM_UPGRADE_DRYRUN_DIR` not honored in upgrade phase when writing kubelet config files. ([#134007](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134007), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kubeadm: Fixed a bug where `ClusterConfiguration.APIServer.TimeoutForControlPlane` from `v1beta3` was not respected in newer kubeadm versions where `v1beta4` is the default. ([#133513](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133513), [@tom1299](https://github.com/tom1299))
- Kubeadm: Fixed a bug where the node registration information for a given node was not fetched correctly during `kubeadm upgrade node` and the node name can end up being incorrect in cases where the node name is not the same as the host name. ([#134319](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134319), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: avoid panicing if the user has malformed the kubeconfig in the cluster-info config map to not include a valid current context. Include proper validation at the appropriate locations and throw errors instead. ([#134715](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134715), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- Kubelet: Fixed an internal deadlock that caused the connection to a DRA driver to become unusable after being idle for 30 minutes. ([#133926](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133926), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Legacy watch calls (RV = 0 or unset) that generate init-events weigh higher in APF seat usage now. Properly accounting for their cost protects the API server from CPU overload. Users might see increased throttling of such calls as a result. ([#134601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134601), [@shyamjvs](https://github.com/shyamjvs)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Prevent a segfault occurring when updating deeply nested JSON fields ([#134381](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134381), [@kon-angelo](https://github.com/kon-angelo)) [SIG API Machinery and CLI]

- The kubelet now honors the configuration userNamespaces.idsPerPod. Before it was ignored. ([#133373](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133373), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Updated `kubectl scale` to return a consistent error message when a specified resource is not found. Previously, it returned: `error: no objects passed to scale <GroupResource> "<ResourceName>" not found`. It now matches the format used by other commands (e.g., `kubectl get`): `Error from server (NotFound): <GroupResource> "<ResourceName>" not found`. ([#134017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134017), [@mochizuki875](https://github.com/mochizuki875))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
