  text: The `SystemdWatchdog` feature gate has been locked to default and will be removed
    in future release. The systemd watchdog functionality in `kubelet` can be enabled
    via systemd without any feature gate configuration. See the [systemd watchdog
    documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/systemd-watchdog/) for
    more information.
