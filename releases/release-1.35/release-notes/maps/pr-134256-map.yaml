releasenote:
  text: Kubernetes API Go types removed runtime use of the `github.com/gogo/protobuf`
    library, and are no longer registered into the global gogo type registry. Kubernetes
    API Go types were not suitable for use with the `google.golang.org/protobuf` library,
    and no longer implement `ProtoMessage()` by default to avoid accidental incompatible
    use. If removal of these marker methods impacts your use, it can be re-enabled
    for one more release with a `kubernetes_protomessage_one_more_release` build tag,
    but will be removed in `v1.36`.
