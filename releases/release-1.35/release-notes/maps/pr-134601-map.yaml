  text: Made legacy watch calls (`ResourceVersion` = 0 or unset) that generate init-events weigh
    higher in `API Priority and Fairness (APF)` seat usage. Properly accounting for their
    cost protects the API server from CPU overload. Users might see increased
    throttling of such calls as a result.
