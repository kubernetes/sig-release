releasenote:
  text: '`kube-controller-manager`: Fixed a `v1.34` regression that triggered a spurious
    rollout of existing StatefulSets when upgrading the control plane from `v1.33`
    to `v1.34`. This fix is guarded by the `StatefulSetSemanticRevisionComparison`
    feature gate, which is enabled by default.'
