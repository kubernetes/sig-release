  text: The Pod Certificates feature moved to beta. The `PodCertificateRequest` feature
    gate is set disabled by default. To use the feature, users must enable the certificates
    API groups in `v1beta1` and enable the `PodCertificateRequest` feature gate. The
    `UserAnnotations` field was added to the `PodCertificateProjection` API and the
    corresponding `UnverifiedUserAnnotations` field was added to the `PodCertificateRequest`
    API.
