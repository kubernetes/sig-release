  text: 'kubeadm: Added the HTTPEndpoints field to `ClusterConfiguration.Etcd.ExternalEtcd`
    in kubeadm (v1beta4). This field allows configuring separate HTTP endpoints for
    etcd communication, such as `/metrics` and `/health`, independent of the primary
    gRPC endpoints. This separation improves access control by allowing HTTP endpoints
    to be exposed without exposing the main gRPC interface. If `HTTPEndpoints` is
    not specified, the existing `Endpoints` field continues to be used for both gRPC
    and HTTP traffic. This corresponds to etcd’s `--listen-client-http-urls` configuration.'
