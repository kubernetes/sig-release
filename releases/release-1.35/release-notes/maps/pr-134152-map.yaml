  text: 'DRA device taints: `DeviceTaintRule` status provides information about the
    rule, including whether Pods still need to be evicted (`EvictionInProgress` condition).
    The newly added `None` effect can be used to preview what a `DeviceTaintRule`
    would do if it used the `NoExecute` effect and to taint devices (`device health`)
    without immediately affecting scheduling or running Pods.'
