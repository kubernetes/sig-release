    ACTION REQUIRED:

    Removed the `--pod-infra-container-image` flag from `kubelet` command line. For `non-kubeadm` clusters, users must manually remove this flag from their `kubelet` configuration to prevent startup failures before upgrading `kubelet`. For `kubeadm` clusters, if users pass extra arguments to the `kubelet` like `--pod-infra-container-image`, it will be written to the `kubelet` env file during the `init` phase. `kubeadm` does not remove it during the `init` or `join` phase, so users must manually remove it from `extraArgs` in the `kubelet` configuration file.
