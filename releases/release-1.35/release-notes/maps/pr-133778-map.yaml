  text: 'kubeadm: stopped applying the `--pod-infra-container-image` flag for the
    kubelet. The flag has been deprecated and no longer served a purpose in the kubelet
    as the logic was migrated to CRI (Container Runtime Interface). During upgrade,
    kubeadm will attempt to remove the flag from the file `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env`.'
