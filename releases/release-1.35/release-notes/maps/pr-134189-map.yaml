  text: Updated the Partitionable Devices feature to support referencing counter sets
    across ResourceSlices within the same resource pool. Devices from incomplete pools
    were no longer considered for allocation. This change introduced backwards-incompatible
    updates to the alpha feature, requiring any ResourceSlices using it to be removed
    before upgrading or downgrading between v1.34 and v1.35.
