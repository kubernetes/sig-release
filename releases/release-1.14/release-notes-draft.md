- Extends functionality to kubectl to support extensions adding new commands as well as overriding specific subcommands (at any depth).
- Documentation fixes
kubernetes/enhancements: [#579](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/579) [[kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/0024-kubectl-plugins.md#summary)]

Durable Local Storage Management is Now GA ([#121](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/121#issuecomment-457396290))

- Makes locally attached (non-network attached) storage available as a persistent volume source.
- Allows users to take advantage of the typically cheaper and improved performance of persistent local storage
kubernetes/kubernetes: [#73525](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73525), [#74391](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74391), [#74769](http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74769)

Pid Limiting is Graduating to Beta ([#757](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/757))

- Prevents a pod from starving pid resource
- Ability to isolate pid resources pod-to-pod and node-to-pod
kubernetes/kubernetes: [#73651](http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73651)
kubernetes/enhancements: [#757](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/757) [[kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20190129-pid-limiting.md)]

Pod Priority and Preemption in Kubernetes ([#564](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/564))

- Pod priority and preemption enables Kubernetes scheduler to schedule more important Pods first and when cluster is out of resources, it removes less important pods to create room for more important ones. The importance is specified by priority.
kubernetes/kubernetes: [#73498](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73498), [#73555](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73555), [#74465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74465)
kubernetes/enhancements: [#564](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/564)  [[kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20190131-pod-priority-preemption.md)]

Pod Ready++ ([#580](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/580))

- Introduces extension point for external feedback on pod readiness.
kubernetes/kubernetes: [#74434](http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74434),
kubernetes/enhancements: [#580](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/580) [[kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md)]

Kubeadm: Automate certificate copy between control planes in HA setups

- Joining control plane nodes to a HA cluster can now be simplified by enabling the optional automatic copy of certificates from an existing control plane node.
- You can now use `kubeadm init --experimental-upload-certs` and `kubeadm join --experimental-control-plane --certificate-key`.
kubernetes/kubeadm: [#1373](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1373)
kubernetes/enhancements: [#357](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/357) [[kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cluster-lifecycle/20190122-Certificates-copy-for-kubeadm-join--control-plane.md)]

Kubeadm: Expose the `kubeadm join` workflow as phases

- The `kubeadm join` command can now be used in phases. Similar to the work that was done for `kubeadm init` in 1.13, in 1.14 the `join` phases can be now executed step-by-step/selectively using the `kubeadm join phase` sub-command. This makes it possible to further customize the workflow of joining nodes to the cluster.
kubernetes/kubeadm: [#1204](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1204)
kubernetes/enhancements: [kep](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cluster-lifecycle/0029-20180918-kubeadm-phases-beta.md)

## Known Issues

- There is a known issue [coredns/coredns#2629](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2629) in CoreDNS 1.3.1, wherein if the Kubernetes API shuts down while CoreDNS is connected, CoreDNS will crash. The issue is fixed in CoreDNS 1.4.0 in [coredns/coredns#2529](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/pull/2529).
- Kubelet might fail to restart if an existing flexvolume mounted pvc contains a large number of directories, or is full. [#75019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75019)

## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- kube-apiserver:
  - Default RBAC policy no longer grants access to discovery and permission-checking APIs (used by `kubectl auth can-i`) to *unauthenticated* users. Upgraded clusters preserve prior behavior, but cluster administrators wishing to grant unauthenticated users access in new clusters will need to explicitly opt-in to expose the discovery and/or permission-checking APIs:
    - `kubectl create clusterrolebinding anonymous-discovery --clusterrole=system:discovery --group=system:unauthenticated`
    - `kubectl create clusterrolebinding anonymous-access-review --clusterrole=system:basic-user --group=system:unauthenticated`
  - The deprecated --storage-versions flag has been removed. The storage versions will always be the default value built-in the kube-apiserver binary. ([#67678](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67678), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))
  - The deprecated `--repair-malformed-updates` flag has been removed ([#73663](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73663), [@danielqsj](https://github.com/danielqsj))
  - The `/swaggerapi/*` schema docs, deprecated since 1.7, have been removed in favor of the /openapi/v2 schema docs. ([#72924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72924), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  - The /swagger.json and /swagger-2.0.0.pb-v1 schema documents, deprecated since v1.10, have been removed in favor of `/openapi/v2` ([#73148](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73148), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  - `kube-apiserver` now only aggregates openapi schemas from `/openapi/v2` endpoints of aggregated API servers. The fallback to aggregate from `/swagger.json` has been removed. Ensure aggregated API servers provide schema information via `/openapi/v2` (available since v1.10). ([#73441](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73441), [@roycaihw](https://github.com/roycaihw))
  - The OpenAPI definitions with the prefix "io.k8s.kubernetes.pkg" (deprecated since 1.9) have been removed. ([#74596](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74596), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts))
  - The `ValidateProxyRedirects` feature was promoted to Beta and enabled by default. This feature restricts redirect-following from the apiserver to same-host redirects.  If nodes are configured to respond to CRI streaming requests on a different host interface than what the apiserver makes requests on (only the case if not using the built-in dockershim & setting the kubelet flag `--redirect-container-streaming=true`), then these requests will be broken. In that case, the feature can be temporarily disabled until the node configuration is corrected. We suggest setting `--redirect-container-streaming=false` on the kubelet to avoid issues.([#72552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72552), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair))

- kubectl
  - The deprecated `--show-all` flag to `kubectl get` has been removed  ([#69255](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69255), [@Pingan2017](https://github.com/Pingan2017))

- kubelet
  - The deprecated `--experimental-fail-swap-on` flag has been removed ([#69552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69552), [@Pingan2017](https://github.com/Pingan2017))
  - Health check (liveness & readiness) probes using an HTTPGetAction will no longer follow redirects to different hostnames from the original probe request. Instead, these non-local redirects will be treated as a Success (the documented behavior). In this case an event with reason "ProbeWarning" will be generated, indicating that the redirect was ignored. If you were previously relying on the redirect to run health checks against different endpoints, you will need to perform the healthcheck logic outside the Kubelet, for instance by proxying the external endpoint rather than redirecting to it. ([#75416](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75416), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair))

- client-go
  - The deprecated versionless API group accessors (like `clientset.Apps()`) have been removed. Use an explicit version instead (like `clientset.AppsV1()`) ([#74422](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74422), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
  - The disk-cached discovery client is moved from k8s.io/client-go/discovery to k8s.io/client-go/discovery/cached/disk.
The memory-cached discovery client is moved from k8s.io/client-go/discovery/cached to k8s.io/client-go/discovery/cached/memory.
([#72214](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72214), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))

- kubeadm
  - `kubeadm alpha preflight` and `kubeadm alpha preflight node` are removed; you can now use `kubeadm join phase preflight` ([#73718](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73718), [@fabriziopandini](https://github.com/fabriziopandini))

- The deprecated taints `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady` and `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable` are no longer supported or adjusted. These uses should be replaced with `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`
 ([#73001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73001), [@shivnagarajan](https://github.com/shivnagarajan))

- Any Prometheus queries that match `pod_name` and `container_name` labels (e.g. cadvisor or kubelet probe metrics) should be updated to use `pod` and `container` instead. `pod_name` and `container_name` labels will be present alongside `pod` and `container` labels for one transitional release and removed in the future.
([#69099](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69099), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman))

- [CRI] Added a new field called `runtime_handler` into `PodSandbox` and `PodSandboxStatus` to track the `RuntimeClass` information of a pod. ([#73833](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73833), [@haiyanmeng](https://github.com/haiyanmeng))
- Kubelet now tries to stop containers in unknown state once before restart or remove. ([#73802](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73802), [@Random-Liu](https://github.com/Random-Liu))
- When pleg channel is full, events are now discarded and count is recorded ([#72709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72709), [@changyaowei](https://github.com/changyaowei))

This admission plugin is enabled by default if the `TaintNodesByCondition` feature is enabled. ([#73097](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73097), [@bsalamat](https://github.com/bsalamat))
- kubelet now accepts `pid=<number>` in the `--system-reserved` and `--kube-reserved` options to ensure that the specified number of process IDs will be reserved for the system as a whole and for Kubernetes system daemons respectively.  Please reference `Kube Reserved` and `System Reserved` in `Reserve Compute Resources for System Daemons` in the Kubernetes documentation for general discussion of resource reservation.  To utilize this functionality, you must set the feature gate `SupportNodePidsLimit=true` ([#73651](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73651)

### Scheduling

- Improved fairness of the scheduling queue by placing pods which are attempted recently behind other pods with the same priority. ([#73700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73700), [@denkensk](https://github.com/denkensk))

- Updated to go1.11.5 ([#73326](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73326), [@ixdy](https://github.com/ixdy))
- Updated to use go1.12.1 ([#75413](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75413), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder))
- e2e tests that require SSH may now be used against clusters that have nodes without external IP addresses by setting the environment variable `KUBE_SSH_BASTION` to the `host:port` of a machine that is allowed to SSH to those nodes.  The same private key that the test would use is used for the bastion host.  The test connects to the bastion and then tunnels another SSH connection to the node. ([#72286](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72286), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
- `PidPressure` now evicts pods from lowest priority to highest priority ([#72844](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72844), [@dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole))
- Split up the mondo `kubernetes-test` tarball into `kubernetes-test-portable` and `kubernetes-test-{OS}-{ARCH}` tarballs. ([#74065](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74065), [@ixdy](https://github.com/ixdy))

### Windows

Support for Windows nodes and Windows containers went going stable.

Support for Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for Windows containers in Kubernetes. GMSA are a specific type of Active Directory account that provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators across multiple servers.

- Fixed smb remount and unmount issues on Windows ([#73661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73661), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx), [#75087](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75087), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx))
- Added network stats for Windows nodes and containers ([#74788](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74788), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))
- The new test `[sig-network] DNS should now provide /etc/hosts entries for the cluster [LinuxOnly] [Conformance]` will validate the host entries set in the ``/etc/hosts`` file (pod's FQDN and hostname), which should be managed by Kubelet. ([#72729](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72729), [@bclau](https://github.com/bclau))
- Allowed the kubelet to pass Windows GMSA credentials down to Docker ([#73726](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73726), [@wk8](https://github.com/wk8))
- Added kube-proxy support for overlay networking and DSR in Windows and new flags for `network-name`, `source-vip`, and `enable-dsr`. ([#70896](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70896), [@ksubrmnn](https://github.com/ksubrmnn))
- windows: Ensured graceful termination when being run as windows service ([#73292](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73292), [@steffengy](https://github.com/steffengy))
- vSphere cloud provider now correctly retrieves the VM's UUID when running on Windows ([#71147](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71147), [@benmoss](https://github.com/benmoss))
- Kubelet: added `usageNanoCores` from CRI stats provider ([#73659](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73659), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))
- Introduced support for Windows nodes into the cluster bringup scripts for GCE. ([#73442](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73442), [@pjh](https://github.com/pjh))
- Added network stats for Windows nodes and pods. ([#70121](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70121), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))
- CoreDNS is only officially supported on Linux at this time.  As such, when kubeadm is used to deploy this component into your kubernetes cluster, it will be restricted (using `nodeSelectors`) to run only on nodes with that operating system. This ensures that in clusters which include Windows nodes, the scheduler will not ever attempt to place CoreDNS pods on these machines, reducing setup latency and enhancing initial cluster stability. ([#69940](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69940), [@MarcPow](https://github.com/MarcPow))
