  text: "The `EndpointSlice` mirroring controller mirrors endpoints annotations and
    labels to the generated endpoint slices, it also ensures that updates on any of
    these fields are mirrored. \nThe well-known annotation `endpoints.kubernetes.io/last-change-trigger-time`
    is skipped and not mirrored."
