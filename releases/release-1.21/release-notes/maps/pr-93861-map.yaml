  text: Add --permit-address-sharing flag to `kube-apiserver` to listen with `SO_REUSEADDR`.
    While allowing to listen on wildcard IPs like 0.0.0.0 and specific IPs in parallel,
    it avoids waiting for the kernel to release socket in `TIME_WAIT` state, and hence,
    considerably reducing `kube-apiserver` restart times under certain conditions.
