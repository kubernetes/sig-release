    Azure file migration graduates to beta, with CSIMigrationAzureFile flag off by default
    as it requires installation of AzureFile CSI Driver. Users should enable CSIMigration and
    CSIMigrationAzureFile features and install the [AzureFile CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver)
    to avoid disruption to existing Pod and PVC objects at that time. Azure File CSI driver does not support using same persistent
    volume with different fsgroups. When CSI migration is enabled for azurefile driver, such case is not supported.
    (there is a case we support where volume is mounted with 0777 and then it readable/writable by everyone)
