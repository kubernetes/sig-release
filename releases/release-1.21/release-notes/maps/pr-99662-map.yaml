  text: The `EndpointSlice` API is now GA. The `EndpointSlice` topology field has
    been removed from the GA API and will be replaced by a new per Endpoint Zone field.
    If the topology field was previously used, it will be converted into an annotation
    in the v1 Resource. The `discovery.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API is removed.
