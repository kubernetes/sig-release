# Release notes for v1.21.0-rc.0

[Documentation](https://docs.k8s.io/docs/home)

# Changelog since v1.20.0

## What's New (Major Themes)

### Deprecation of PodSecurityPolicy

PSP as an admission controller resource is being deprecated. Deployed PodSecurityPolicy's will keep working until version 1.25, their target removal from the codebase. A new feature, with a working title of "PSP replacement policy", is being developed in [KEP-2579](https://features.k8s.io/2579). To learn more, read [PodSecurityPolicy Deprecation: Past, Present, and Future](https://blog.k8s.io/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/).

### Kubernetes API Reference Documentation

The API reference is now generated with [`gen-resourcesdocs`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/reference-docs/tree/c96658d89fb21037b7d00d27e6dbbe6b32375837/gen-resourcesdocs) and it is moving to [Kubernetes API](https://docs.k8s.io/reference/kubernetes-api/)

### Kustomize Updates in Kubectl

[Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) version in kubectl had a jump from v2.0.3 to [v4.0.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98946). Kustomize is now treated as a library and future updates will be less sporadic.

### Default Container Labels

Pod with multiple containers can use `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container` label to have a container preselected for kubectl commands. More can be read in [KEP-2227](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/2227-kubectl-default-container/README.md).

### Immutable Secrets and ConfigMaps

Immutable Secrets and ConfigMaps graduates to GA. This feature allows users to specify that the contents of a particular Secret or ConfigMap is immutable for its object lifetime. For such instances, Kubelet will not watch/poll for changes and therefore reducing apiserver load.

### Structured Logging in Kubelet

Kubelet has adopted structured logging, thanks to community effort in accomplishing this within the release timeline. Structured logging in the project remains an ongoing effort -- for folks interested in participating, [keep an eye / chime in to the mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/y4WIw-ntUR8).

### Storage Capacity Tracking

Traditionally, the Kubernetes scheduler was based on the assumptions that additional persistent storage is available everywhere in the cluster and has infinite capacity. Topology constraints addressed the first point, but up to now pod scheduling was still done without considering that the remaining storage capacity may not be enough to start a new pod. [Storage capacity tracking](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/) addresses that by adding an API for a CSI driver to report storage capacity and uses that information in the Kubernetes scheduler when choosing a node for a pod. This feature serves as a stepping stone for supporting dynamic provisioning for local volumes and other volume types that are more capacity constrained.

### Generic Ephemeral Volumes

[Generic ephermeral volumes](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volumes) feature allows any existing storage driver that supports dynamic provisioning to be used as an ephemeral volume with the volumeâ€™s lifecycle bound to the Pod. It can be used to provide scratch storage that is different from the root disk, for example persistent memory, or a separate local disk on that node. All StorageClass parameters for volume provisioning are supported. All features supported with PersistentVolumeClaims are supported, such as storage capacity tracking, snapshots and restore, and volume resizing.

### CSI Service Account Token

CSI Service Account Token feature moves to Beta in 1.21. This feature improves the security posture and allows CSI drivers to receive pods' [bound service account tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/1205-bound-service-account-tokens/README.md). This feature also provides a knob to re-publish volumes so that short-lived volumes can be refreshed.

### CSI Health Monitoring

The CSI health monitoring feature is being released as a second Alpha in Kubernetes 1.21. This feature enables CSI Drivers to share abnormal volume conditions from the underlying storage systems with Kubernetes so that they can be reported as events on PVCs or Pods. This feature serves as a stepping stone towards programmatic detection and resolution of individual volume health issues by Kubernetes.

## Known Issues

### `TopologyAwareHints` feature falls back to default behavior

The feature gate currently falls back to the default behavior in most cases. Enabling the feature gate will add hints to `EndpointSlices`, but functional differences are only observed in non-dual stack kube-proxy implementation. [The fix will be available in coming releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100804).

## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kube-proxy's IPVS proxy mode no longer sets the net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet sysctl parameter. Nodes upgrading will have net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet set to 1 but new nodes will inherit the system default (usually 0). If you relied on any behavior requiring net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet, you must set ensure it is enabled as kube-proxy will no longer set it automatically. This change helps to further mitigate CVE-2020-8558. ([#92938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92938), [@lbernail](https://github.com/lbernail)) [SIG Network and Release]
 - Kubeadm: during "init" an empty cgroupDriver value in the KubeletConfiguration is now always set to "systemd" unless the user is explicit about it. This requires existing machine setups to configure the container runtime to use the "systemd" driver. Documentation on this topic can be found here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/. When upgrading existing clusters / nodes using "kubeadm upgrade" the old cgroupDriver value is preserved, but in 1.22 this change will also apply to "upgrade". For more information on migrating to the "systemd" driver or remaining on the "cgroupfs" driver see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/. ([#99471](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99471), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
 - Newly provisioned PVs by EBS plugin will no longer use the deprecated "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone" and "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region" labels. It will use "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" and "topology.kubernetes.io/region" labels instead. ([#99130](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99130), [@ayberk](https://github.com/ayberk)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Storage and Testing]
 - Newly provisioned PVs by OpenStack Cinder plugin will no longer use the deprecated "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone" and "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region" labels. It will use "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" and "topology.kubernetes.io/region" labels instead. ([#99719](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99719), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Storage]
 - Newly provisioned PVs by gce-pd will no longer have the beta FailureDomain label. gce-pd volume plugin will start to have GA topology label instead. ([#98700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98700), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Storage and Testing]
 - OpenStack Cinder CSI migration is on by default, Clinder CSI driver must be installed on clusters on OpenStack for Cinder volumes to work. ([#98538](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98538), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Storage]
 - Remove alpha `CSIMigrationXXComplete` flag and add alpha `InTreePluginXXUnregister` flag. Deprecate `CSIMigrationvSphereComplete` flag and it will be removed in v1.22. ([#98243](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98243), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227))
 - Remove storage metrics `storage_operation_errors_total`, since we already have `storage_operation_status_count`.And add new field `status` for `storage_operation_duration_seconds`, so that we can know about all status storage operation latency. ([#98332](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98332), [@JornShen](https://github.com/JornShen)) [SIG Instrumentation and Storage]
 - The metric `storage_operation_errors_total` is not removed, but is marked deprecated, and the metric `storage_operation_status_count` is marked deprecated. In both cases the `storage_operation_duration_seconds` metric can be used to recover equivalent counts (using `status=fail-unknown` in the case of `storage_operations_errors_total`). ([#99045](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99045), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
 - `ServiceNodeExclusion`, `NodeDisruptionExclusion` and `LegacyNodeRoleBehavior` features have been promoted to GA. `ServiceNodeExclusion` and `NodeDisruptionExclusion` are now unconditionally enabled, while `LegacyNodeRoleBehavior` is unconditionally disabled. To prevent control plane nodes from being added to load balancers automatically, upgrade users need to add "node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers" label to control plane nodes. ([#97543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97543), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))

([#98312](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98312), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- `audit.k8s.io/v1beta1` and `audit.k8s.io/v1alpha1` audit policy configuration and audit events are deprecated in favor of `audit.k8s.io/v1`, available since v1.13. kube-apiserver invocations that specify alpha or beta policy configurations with `--audit-policy-file`, or explicitly request alpha or beta audit events with `--audit-log-version` / `--audit-webhook-version` must update to use `audit.k8s.io/v1` and accept `audit.k8s.io/v1` events prior to v1.24. ([#98858](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98858), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Auth]

  Multi vCenter support is deprecated as of v1.21. If you have a Kubernetes cluster spanning across multiple vCenter servers, please consider moving all k8s nodes to a single vCenter Server. vSphere CSI Driver does not support Kubernetes deployment spanning across multiple vCenter servers.
  
  Support for these deprecations will be available till Kubernetes v1.24. ([#98546](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98546), [@divyenpatel](https://github.com/divyenpatel))

### API Change

- 1. PodAffinityTerm includes a namespaceSelector field to allow selecting eligible namespaces based on their labels. 
  2. A new CrossNamespacePodAffinity quota scope API that allows restricting which namespaces allowed to use PodAffinityTerm with corss-namespace reference via namespaceSelector or namespaces fields. ([#98582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98582), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Testing]

- Added `.spec.completionMode` field to Job, with accepted values `NonIndexed` (default) and `Indexed`. This is an alpha field and is only honored by servers with the `IndexedJob` feature gate enabled. ([#98441](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98441), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG Apps and CLI]
- Adds support for endPort field in NetworkPolicy ([#97058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- CSIServiceAccountToken graduates to Beta and enabled by default. ([#99298](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99298), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang))
- Cluster admins can now turn off `/debug/pprof` and `/debug/flags/v` endpoint in kubelet by setting `enableProfilingHandler` and `enableDebugFlagsHandler` to `false` in the Kubelet configuration file. Options `enableProfilingHandler` and `enableDebugFlagsHandler` can be set to `true` only when `enableDebuggingHandlers` is also set to `true`. ([#98458](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98458), [@SaranBalaji90](https://github.com/SaranBalaji90))
- DaemonSets accept a MaxSurge integer or percent on their rolling update strategy that will launch the updated pod on nodes and wait for those pods to go ready before marking the old out-of-date pods as deleted. This allows workloads to avoid downtime during upgrades when deployed using DaemonSets. This feature is alpha and is behind the DaemonSetUpdateSurge feature gate. ([#96441](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96441), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton)) [SIG Apps and Testing]
- Enable SPDY pings to keep connections alive, so that `kubectl exec` and `kubectl portforward` won't be interrupted. ([#97083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97083), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery and CLI]
- FieldManager no longer owns fields that get reset before the object is persisted (e.g. "status wiping"). ([#99661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99661), [@kevindelgado](https://github.com/kevindelgado)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

- IngressClass resource can now reference a resource in a specific namespace 
  for implementation-specific configuration (previously only Cluster-level resources were allowed). 
  This feature can be enabled using the IngressClassNamespacedParams feature gate. ([#99275](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99275), [@hbagdi](https://github.com/hbagdi))
- Jobs API has a new `.spec.suspend` field that can be used to suspend and resume Jobs. This is an alpha field which is only honored by servers with the `SuspendJob` feature gate enabled. ([#98727](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98727), [@adtac](https://github.com/adtac))

- Namespace API objects now have a `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label matching their metadata.name field to allow selecting any namespace by its name using a label selector. ([#96968](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96968), [@jayunit100](https://github.com/jayunit100)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Cloud Provider, Storage and Testing]
- One new field "InternalTrafficPolicy" in Service is added.
  It specifies if the cluster internal traffic should be routed to all endpoints or node-local endpoints only.
  "Cluster" routes internal traffic to a Service to all endpoints.
  "Local" routes traffic to node-local endpoints only, and traffic is dropped if no node-local endpoints are ready.
  The default value is "Cluster". ([#96600](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96600), [@maplain](https://github.com/maplain)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Network]
- PodDisruptionBudget API objects can now contain conditions in status. ([#98127](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98127), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle and Instrumentation]
- PodSecurityPolicy only stores "generic" as allowed volume type if the GenericEphemeralVolume feature gate is enabled ([#98918](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98918), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Auth and Security]
- Promote CronJobs to batch/v1 ([#99423](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99423), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI and Testing]

([#97615](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97615), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Remove support for building Kubernetes with bazel. ([#99561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99561), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]
- Scheduler extender filter interface now can report unresolvable failed nodes in the new field `FailedAndUnresolvableNodes` of  `ExtenderFilterResult` struct. Nodes in this map will be skipped in the preemption phase. ([#92866](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92866), [@cofyc](https://github.com/cofyc)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Services can specify loadBalancerClass to use a custom load balancer ([#98277](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98277), [@XudongLiuHarold](https://github.com/XudongLiuHarold))
- Storage capacity tracking (= the CSIStorageCapacity feature) graduates to Beta and enabled by default, storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1/VolumeAttachment and storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1/CSIStorageCapacity objects are deprecated ([#99641](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99641), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Support for Indexed Job: a Job that is considered completed when Pods associated to indexes from 0 to (.spec.completions-1) have succeeded. ([#98812](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98812), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG Apps and CLI]
- The BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature has been promoted to beta, and enabled by default.
  - This changes the tokens provided to containers at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` to be time-limited, auto-refreshed, and invalidated when the containing pod is deleted.
  - Clients should reload the token from disk periodically (once per minute is recommended) to ensure they continue to use a valid token. `k8s.io/client-go` version v11.0.0+ and v0.15.0+ reload tokens automatically.
  - By default, injected tokens are given an extended lifetime so they remain valid even after a new refreshed token is provided. The metric `serviceaccount_stale_tokens_total` can be used to monitor for workloads that are depending on the extended lifetime and are continuing to use tokens even after a refreshed token is provided to the container. If that metric indicates no existing workloads are depending on extended lifetimes, injected token lifetime can be shortened to 1 hour by starting `kube-apiserver` with `--service-account-extend-token-expiration=false`. ([#95667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95667), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- The EndpointSlice Controllers are now GA. The `EndpointSliceController` will not populate the `deprecatedTopology` field and will only provide topology information through the `zone` and `nodeName` fields. ([#99870](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99870), [@swetharepakula](https://github.com/swetharepakula))
- The Endpoints controller will now set the `endpoints.kubernetes.io/over-capacity` annotation to "warning" when an Endpoints resource contains more than 1000 addresses. In a future release, the controller will truncate Endpoints that exceed this limit. The EndpointSlice API can be used to support significantly larger number of addresses. ([#99975](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99975), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- The PodDisruptionBudget API has been promoted to policy/v1 with no schema changes. The only functional change is that an empty selector (`{}`) written to a policy/v1 PodDisruptionBudget now selects all pods in the namespace. The behavior of the policy/v1beta1 API remains unchanged. The policy/v1beta1 PodDisruptionBudget API is deprecated and will no longer be served in 1.25+. ([#99290](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99290), [@mortent](https://github.com/mortent)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Scheduling and Testing]
- The `EndpointSlice` API is now GA. The `EndpointSlice` topology field has been removed from the GA API and will be replaced by a new per Endpoint Zone field. If the topology field was previously used, it will be converted into an annotation in the v1 Resource. The `discovery.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API is removed. ([#99662](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99662), [@swetharepakula](https://github.com/swetharepakula))
- The `controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost` annotation can be set to offer a hint on the cost of deleting a `Pod` compared to other pods belonging to the same ReplicaSet. Pods with lower deletion cost are deleted first. This is an alpha feature. ([#99163](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99163), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g))
- The kube-apiserver now resets `managedFields` that got corrupted by a mutating admission controller. ([#98074](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98074), [@kwiesmueller](https://github.com/kwiesmueller))
- Topology Aware Hints are now available in alpha and can be enabled with the `TopologyAwareHints` feature gate. ([#99522](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99522), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Instrumentation, Network and Testing]
- Users might specify the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-exec-container` annotation in a Pod to preselect container for kubectl commands. ([#97099](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97099), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG CLI]

For now, users can try such experience by enabling --ignore-errors flag. ([#98203](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98203), [@yuzhiquan](https://github.com/yuzhiquan))
- Add --permit-address-sharing flag to `kube-apiserver` to listen with `SO_REUSEADDR`. While allowing to listen on wildcard IPs like 0.0.0.0 and specific IPs in parallel, it avoids waiting for the kernel to release socket in `TIME_WAIT` state, and hence, considerably reducing `kube-apiserver` restart times under certain conditions. ([#93861](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93861), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts))

### Documentation

- Azure file migration graduates to beta, with CSIMigrationAzureFile flag off by default
  as it requires installation of AzureFile CSI Driver. Users should enable CSIMigration and
  CSIMigrationAzureFile features and install the [AzureFile CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver)
  to avoid disruption to existing Pod and PVC objects at that time. Azure File CSI driver does not support using same persistent
  volume with different fsgroups. When CSI migration is enabled for azurefile driver, such case is not supported.
  (there is a case we support where volume is mounted with 0777 and then it readable/writable by everyone) ([#96293](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96293), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx))

- The feature gates `WindowsGMSA` and `WindowsRunAsUserName` that are GA since v1.18 are now removed. ([#96531](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96531), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov)) [SIG Node and Windows]
- The new `-gce-zones` flag on the `e2e.test` binary instructs tests that check for information about how the cluster interacts with the cloud to limit their queries to the provided zone list. If not specified, the current behavior of asking the cloud provider for all available zones in multi zone clusters is preserved. ([#98787](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98787), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton)) [SIG API Machinery, Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Update cri-tools to [v1.20.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases/tag/v1.20.0) ([#97967](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97967), [@rajibmitra](https://github.com/rajibmitra)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Windows nodes on GCE will take longer to start due to dependencies installed at node creation time. ([#98284](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98284), [@pjh](https://github.com/pjh)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- `apiserver_storage_objects` (a newer version of `etcd_object_counts`) is promoted and marked as stable. ([#100082](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100082), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan))

- GCE L4 Loadbalancers now handle > 5 ports in service spec correctly. ([#99595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99595), [@prameshj](https://github.com/prameshj)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- The DownwardAPIHugePages feature is beta.  Users may use the feature if all workers in their cluster are min 1.20 version.  The feature will be enabled by default in all installations in 1.22.
