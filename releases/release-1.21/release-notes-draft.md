# Release notes for v1.21.0-beta.0

[Documentation](https://docs.k8s.io/docs/home)
# Changelog since v1.20.0

## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kube-proxy's IPVS proxy mode no longer sets the net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet sysctl parameter. Nodes upgrading will have net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet set to 1 but new nodes will inherit the system default (usually 0). If you relied on any behavior requiring net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet, you must set ensure it is enabled as kube-proxy will no longer set it automatically. This change helps to further mitigate CVE-2020-8558. ([#92938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92938), [@lbernail](https://github.com/lbernail)) [SIG Network and Release]
 - Newly provisioned PVs by gce-pd will no longer have the beta FailureDomain label. gce-pd volume plugin will start to have GA topology label instead. ([#98700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98700), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Storage and Testing]
 - Remove alpha `CSIMigrationXXComplete` flag and add alpha `InTreePluginXXUnregister` flag. Deprecate `CSIMigrationvSphereComplete` flag and it will be removed in v1.22. ([#98243](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98243), [@Jiawei0227](https://github.com/Jiawei0227))
 - Remove storage metrics `storage_operation_errors_total`, since we already have `storage_operation_status_count`.And add new field `status` for `storage_operation_duration_seconds`, so that we can know about all status storage operation latency. ([#98332](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98332), [@JornShen](https://github.com/JornShen)) [SIG Instrumentation and Storage]
 - The metric `storage_operation_errors_total` is not removed, but is marked deprecated, and the metric `storage_operation_status_count` is marked deprecated. In both cases the `storage_operation_duration_seconds` metric can be used to recover equivalent counts (using `status=fail-unknown` in the case of `storage_operations_errors_total`). ([#99045](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99045), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
 - `ServiceNodeExclusion`, `NodeDisruptionExclusion` and `LegacyNodeRoleBehavior` features have been promoted to GA. `ServiceNodeExclusion` and `NodeDisruptionExclusion` are now unconditionally enabled, while `LegacyNodeRoleBehavior` is unconditionally disabled. To prevent control plane nodes from being added to load balancers automatically, upgrade users need to add "node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers" label to control plane nodes. ([#97543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97543), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Aborting the drain command in a list of nodes will be deprecated. The new behavior will make the drain command go through all nodes even if one or more nodes failed during the drain. For now, users can try such experience by enabling --ignore-errors flag. ([#98203](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98203), [@yuzhiquan](https://github.com/yuzhiquan))
- Deprecate the `topologyKeys` field in Service. This capability will be replaced with upcoming work around Topology Aware Subsetting and Service Internal Traffic Policy. ([#96736](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96736), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim)) [SIG Apps]
- Kubeadm: deprecated command "alpha selfhosting pivot" is now removed. ([#97627](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97627), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- Kubeadm: graduate the command `kubeadm alpha kubeconfig user` to `kubeadm kubeconfig user`. The `kubeadm alpha kubeconfig user` command is deprecated now. ([#97583](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97583), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: the "kubeadm alpha certs" command is removed now, please use "kubeadm certs" instead. ([#97706](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97706), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Official support to build kubernetes with docker-machine / remote docker is removed. This change does not affect building kubernetes with docker locally. ([#97935](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97935), [@adeniyistephen](https://github.com/adeniyistephen)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Remove deprecated --cleanup-ipvs flag of kube-proxy, and make --cleanup flag always to flush IPVS ([#97336](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97336), [@maaoBit](https://github.com/maaoBit)) [SIG Network]
- Remove deprecated mixed procotol annotation on Azure provider. Use `MixedProtocolLBService` instead. ([#97096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97096), [@nilo19](https://github.com/nilo19))
- Remove the deprecated metrics "scheduling_algorithm_preemption_evaluation_seconds" and "binding_duration_seconds", suggest to use "scheduler_framework_extension_point_duration_seconds" instead. ([#96447](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96447), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Scheduling and Testing]

- The `batch/v2alpha1` CronJob type definitions and clients are deprecated and removed. ([#96987](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96987), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI and Testing]
- The `export` query parameter (inconsistently supported by API resources and deprecated in v1.14) is fully removed.  Requests setting this query parameter will now receive a 400 status response. ([#98312](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98312), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- TokenRequest and TokenRequestProjection feature gates are now unconditionally enabled. ([#97148](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97148), [@wawa0210](https://github.com/wawa0210))

### API Change

- Adds support for portRange / EndPort in Network Policy ([#97058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058), [@rikatz](https://github.com/rikatz)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Change the APIVersion proto name of BoundObjectRef from aPIVersion to apiVersion. ([#97379](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97379), [@kebe7jun](https://github.com/kebe7jun)) [SIG Auth]
- Cluster admins can now turn off /debug/pprof and /debug/flags/v endpoint in kubelet by setting enableProfilingHandler and enableDebugFlagsHandler to false in their kubelet configuration file. enableProfilingHandler and enableDebugFlagsHandler can be set to true only when enableDebuggingHandlers is also set to true. ([#98458](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98458), [@SaranBalaji90](https://github.com/SaranBalaji90)) [SIG Node]
- Enable SPDY pings to keep connections alive, so that `kubectl exec` and `kubectl portforward` won't be interrupted. ([#97083](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97083), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery and CLI]
- Fixes server-side apply for APIService resources. ([#98576](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98576), [@kevindelgado](https://github.com/kevindelgado))
- Kubernetes is now built using go1.15.7 ([#98363](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98363), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Node, Release and Testing]
- Promote Immutable Secrets/ConfigMaps feature to Stable.
  This allows to set `Immutable` field in Secrets or ConfigMap object to mark their contents as immutable. ([#97615](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97615), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Scheduler extender filter interface now can report unresolvable failed nodes in the new field `FailedAndUnresolvableNodes` of  `ExtenderFilterResult` struct. Nodes in this map will be skipped in the preemption phase. ([#92866](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92866), [@cofyc](https://github.com/cofyc)) [SIG Scheduling]
- The BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature has been promoted to beta, and enabled by default.
  - This changes the tokens provided to containers at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` to be time-limited, auto-refreshed, and invalidated when the containing pod is deleted.
  - Clients should reload the token from disk periodically (once per minute is recommended) to ensure they continue to use a valid token. `k8s.io/client-go` version v11.0.0+ and v0.15.0+ reload tokens automatically.
  - By default, injected tokens are given an extended lifetime so they remain valid even after a new refreshed token is provided. The metric `serviceaccount_stale_tokens_total` can be used to monitor for workloads that are depending on the extended lifetime and are continuing to use tokens even after a refreshed token is provided to the container. If that metric indicates no existing workloads are depending on extended lifetimes, injected token lifetime can be shortened to 1 hour by starting `kube-apiserver` with `--service-account-extend-token-expiration=false`. ([#95667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95667), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]

### Feature

- Add --permit-address-sharing flag to `kube-apiserver` to listen with `SO_REUSEADDR`. While allowing to listen on wildcard IPs like 0.0.0.0 and specific IPs in parallel, it avoids waiting for the kernel to release socket in `TIME_WAIT` state, and hence, considerably reducing `kube-apiserver` restart times under certain conditions.

- Kubectl: `kubectl get` will omit managed fields by default now. Users could set `--show-managed-fields` to true to show managedFields when the output format is either `json` or `yaml`. ([#96878](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96878), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built using go1.15.8 ([#98834](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98834), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Release and Testing]
- Metrics can now be disabled explicitly via a command line flag (i.e. '--disabled-metrics=bad_metric1,bad_metric2') ([#99217](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99217), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan)) [SIG API Machinery, Cluster Lifecycle and Instrumentation]
- New Admission Controller "DenyServiceExternalIPs" is made available. Clusters which do not need the service "ExternalIPs" feature should enable this controller. ([#97395](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97395), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Overall, enable the feature of `PreferNominatedNode` will  improve the performance of scheduling where preemption might frequently happen, but in theory, enable the feature of `PreferNominatedNode`, the pod might not be scheduled to the best candidate node in the cluster. ([#93179](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93179), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]

  takes into consideration global ip addresses on loopback interfaces when:
      - the host has default routes
      - there are no global IPs on those interfaces.
  in order to support more complex network scenarios like BGP Unnumbered RFC 5549 ([#95790](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95790), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network]

### Documentation

- Feat: azure file migration go beta in 1.21. Feature gates CSIMigration to Beta (on by default) and CSIMigrationAzureFile to Beta (off by default since it requires installation of the AzureFile CSI Driver)
  The in-tree AzureFile plugin "kubernetes.io/azure-file" is now deprecated and will be removed in 1.23. Users should enable CSIMigration + CSIMigrationAzureFile features and install the AzureFile CSI Driver (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver) to avoid disruption to existing Pod and PVC objects at that time.
  Users should start using the AzureFile CSI Driver directly for any new volumes. ([#96293](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96293), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
