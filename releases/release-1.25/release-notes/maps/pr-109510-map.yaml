  text: Added the latest GCE pinhole firewall feature, which introduces `destination-ranges`
    in the ingress `firewall-rules`. It restricts access to the backend IPs by allowing
    traffic through `ILB` or `NetLB` only. This change does **NOT** change the existing
    `ILB` or `NetLB` behavior.
