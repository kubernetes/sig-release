  text: EndpointSlices with Pod referencing Nodes that don't exist couldn't be created
    or updated. The behavior on the EndpointSlice controller has been modified to update
    the EndpointSlice without the Pods that reference non-existing Nodes and keep
    retrying until all Pods reference existing Nodes. However, if `service.Spec.PublishNotReadyAddresses`
    is set, all the Pods are published without retrying. Fixed EndpointSlices metrics
    to reflect correctly the number of desired EndpointSlices when no endpoints are
    present.
