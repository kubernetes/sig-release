  text: Support for the alpha seccomp annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod`
    and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io`, deprecated since v1.19,
    was partially removed. Kubelets no longer support the annotations, use of the
    annotations in static pods is no longer supported, and the seccomp annotations
    are no longer auto-populated when pods with seccomp fields are created. Auto-population
    of the seccomp fields from the annotations is planned to be removed in 1.27. Pods  should
    use the corresponding pod or container `securityContext.seccompProfile` field
    instead.
