  text: 'Kubeadm: modified the etcd static Pod `liveness` and `readiness` probes to use
    a new etcd `v3.5.3+` HTTP(s) health check endpoint `/health?serializable=true` that
    allows to track the health of individual etcd members and not fail all members
    if a single member is not healthy in the etcd cluster.'
