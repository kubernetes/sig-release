  text: There is a new OCI image registry (`registry.k8s.io`) that can be used to
    pull Kubernetes images. The old registry (`k8s.gcr.io`) will continue to be supported
    for the foreseeable future, but the new name should perform better because it
    frontends equivalent mirrors in other clouds.  Please point your clusters to the
    new registry going forward. \n\nAdmission/Policy integrations that have an allowlist
    of registries need to include `registry.k8s.io` alongside `k8s.gcr.io`.\nAir-gapped
    environments and image garbage-collection configurations will need to update to
    pre-pull and preserve required images under `registry.k8s.io` as well as `k8s.gcr.io`.
