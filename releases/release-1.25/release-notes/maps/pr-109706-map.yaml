  text: Reduced the number of cloud API calls and service downtime caused by excessive
    re-configurations of cluster LBs with externalTrafficPolicy=Local when node readiness
    changes (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/111539). The service
    controller (in cloud-controller-manager) will avoid resyncing nodes which are
    transitioning between `Ready` / `NotReady` (only for for ETP=Local Services).  The
    LBs used for these services will solely rely on the health check probe defined
    by the `healthCheckNodePort` to determine if a particular node is to be used for
    traffic load balancing.
