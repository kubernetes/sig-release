  text: 'Kubeadm: enhanced the "patches" functionality to be able to patch kubelet
    config files containing `v1beta1.KubeletConfiguration`. The new patch target is
    called `kubeletconfiguration` (e.g. patch file `kubeletconfiguration+json.json`).This
    makes it possible to apply node specific KubeletConfiguration options during `init`,
    `join` and `upgrade`, while the main `KubeletConfiguration` that is passed to `init`
    as part of the `--config` file can still act as the global stored in the cluster
    `KubeletConfiguration`.'
