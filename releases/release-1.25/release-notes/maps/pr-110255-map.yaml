  text: The pod phase lifecycle guarantees that terminal Pods, those whose states
    are `Unready` or `Succeeded`, can not regress and will have all container stopped.
    Hence, terminal Pods will never be reachable and should not publish their IP addresses
    on the `Endpoints` or `EndpointSlices`, independently of the Service `TolerateUnready`
    option.
