  text: This release added support for `NodeExpandSecret` for CSI driver client which
    enables the CSI drivers to make use of this secret while performing node expansion
    operation based on the user request. Previously there was no secret  provided
    as part of the `nodeexpansion` call, thus CSI drivers did not make use of the same
    while expanding the volume at the node side.
