    In "large" clusters, kube-proxy in iptables mode will now sometimes
    leave unused rules in iptables for a while (up to `--iptables-sync-period`)
    before deleting them. This improves performance by not requiring it to
    check for stale rules on every sync. (In smaller clusters, it will still
    remove unused rules immediately once they are no longer used.)

    (The threshold for "large" used here is currently "1000 endpoints" but
    this is subject to change.)
