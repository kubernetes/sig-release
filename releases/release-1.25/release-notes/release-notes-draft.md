## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Deprecated beta APIs scheduled for removal in 1.25 are no longer served. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-25 for more information. ([#108797](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108797), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k)) [SIG API Machinery, Instrumentation and Testing]
 - No action required; No API/CLI changed; Add new Windows Image Support ([#110333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110333), [@liurupeng](https://github.com/liurupeng)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Windows]
 - There is a new OCI image registry (registry.k8s.io) that can be used to pull kubernetes images. The old registry (k8s.gcr.io) will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future, but the new name should perform better because it frontends equivalent mirrors in other clouds.  Please point your clusters to the new registry going forward. 
  
  Admission/Policy integrations that have an allowlist of registries need to include "registry.k8s.io" alongside "k8s.gcr.io".
  Air-gapped environments and image garbage-collection configurations will need to update to pre-pull and preserve required images under "registry.k8s.io" as well as "k8s.gcr.io". ([#109938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109938), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, K8s Infra, Node, Release, Scalability, Storage and Testing]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Kube-controller-manager:  'deleting-pods-qps'  'deleting-pods-burst'  'register-retry-count' flags are removed. ([#109612](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109612), [@pandaamanda](https://github.com/pandaamanda)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kubeadm: during "upgrade apply/diff/node", in case the "ClusterConfiguration.imageRepository" stored in the "kubeadm-config" ConfigMap contains the legacy "k8s.gcr.io" repository, modify it to the new default "registry.k8s.io". Reflect the change in the in-cluster ConfigMap only during "upgrade apply". ([#110343](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110343), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: graduate the kubeadm specific feature gate UnversionedKubeletConfigMap to GA and lock it to "true" by default. The kubelet related ConfigMap and RBAC rules are now locked to have a simplified naming "*kubelet-config" instead of the legacy naming "*kubelet-config-x.yy", where "x.yy" was the version of the control plane. If you have previously used the old naming format with UnversionedKubeletConfigMap=false, you must manually copy the config map from kube-system/kubelet-config-x.yy to kube-system/kubelet-config before upgrading to 1.25. ([#110327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110327), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: stop applying the "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule" taint to control plane nodes for new clusters. Remove the taint from existing control plane nodes during "kubeadm upgrade apply" ([#110095](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110095), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- The `gcp` and `azure` auth plugins have been removed from client-go and kubectl. See https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin and https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke for details about the cloud-specific replacements. ([#110013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110013), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- The beta `PodSecurityPolicy` admission plugin, deprecated since 1.21, is removed. Follow the instructions at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/ to migrate to the built-in PodSecurity admission plugin (or to another third-party policy webhook) prior to upgrading to v1.25. ([#109798](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109798), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Node, Security, Storage and Testing]

### API Change

- Introduce NodeInclusionPolicies to specify nodeAffinity/nodeTaint strategy when calculating pod topology spread skew. ([#108492](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108492), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]
- The `metadata.clusterName` field is completely removed. This should not have any user-visible impact. ([#109602](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109602), [@lavalamp](https://github.com/lavalamp)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Testing]
- This release add support for NodeExpandSecret for CSI driver client which enables the CSI drivers to make use of this secret while performing node expansion operation based on the user request. Previously there was no secret  provided as part of the nodeexpansion call, thus CSI drivers were not make use of the same while expanding the volume at node side. ([#105963](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105963), [@zhucan](https://github.com/zhucan)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Storage]

### Feature

([#109995](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109995), [@wangyysde](https://github.com/wangyysde)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: enhance the "patches" functionality to be able to patch kubelet config files containing v1beta1.KubeletConfiguration. The new patch target is called "kubeletconfiguration" (e.g. patch file "kubeletconfiguration+json.json"). This makes it possible to apply node specific KubeletConfiguration options during "init", "join" and "upgrade", while the main KubeletConfiguration that is passed to "init" as part of the "--config" file can still act as the global / stored in the cluster KubeletConfiguration. ([#110405](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110405), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: modify the etcd static Pod liveness and readyness probes to use a new etcd 3.5.3+ HTTP(s) health check endpoint "/health?serializable=true" that allows to track the health of individual etcd members and not fail all members if a single member is not healthy in the etcd cluster. ([#110072](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110072), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: support experimental JSON/YAML output for "kubeadm upgrade plan" with the "--output" flag ([#108447](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108447), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- Kubernetes is now built with Golang 1.18.3 ([#110421](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110421), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Lock CSIMigrationAzureDisk feature gate to default ([#110491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110491), [@andyzhangx](https://github.com/andyzhangx)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- MaxUnavailable for StatefulSets, allows faster RollingUpdate by taking down more than 1 pod at a time. The number of pods you want to take down during a RollingUpdate is configurable using maxUnavailable parameter. ([#109251](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109251), [@krmayankk](https://github.com/krmayankk)) [SIG Apps and CLI]
- Return a warning when applying a pod-security.kubernetes.io label to a PodSecurity-exempted namespace.
  Stop including the pod-security.kubernetes.io/exempt=namespace audit annotation on namespace requests. ([#109680](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109680), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG Auth]
- TopologySpreadConstraints will be shown in describe command for pods, deployments, daemonsets, etc. ([#109563](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109563), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI]
- Updat debian-base, debian-iptables, and setcap images:
  - debian-base:bullseye-v1.3.0
  - debian-iptables:bullseye-v1.4.0
  - setcap:bullseye-v1.3.0 ([#110558](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110558), [@wespanther](https://github.com/wespanther)) [SIG Architecture, Release and Testing]
- When using the OpenStack legacy cloud provider, kubelet and KCM will ignore unknown configuration directives rather than failing to start. ([#109709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109709), [@mdbooth](https://github.com/mdbooth)) [SIG Cloud Provider]

### Failing Test

- E2e tests: the e2e image, agnhost:2.38, has a bug and it hangs instead of exiting if a SIGTERM signal is received and the shutdown-delay option is 0` ([#110214](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110214), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Testing]
- In-tree GCE PD test cases no longer run in Kubernetes testing harness anymore (side effect of switching on csi migration in 1.22). Please switch on environment variable ENABLE_STORAGE_GCE_PD_DRIVER to "yes" if you need to run these tests. ([#109541](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109541), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Storage and Testing]

([#108414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108414), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kubeadm: only taint control plane nodes when the legacy "master" taint is present. This avoids a bug where "kubeadm upgrade" will re-taint a control plane node with the new "control plane" taint even if the user explicitly untainted the node. ([#109840](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109840), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: pass the host OS environment variables when executing "crictl" during image pulls. This fixes a bug where *PROXY environment variables did not affect crictl's internet connectivity.

- ManagedFields time is correctly updated when the value of a managed field is modified. ([#110058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110058), [@glebiller](https://github.com/glebiller)) [SIG API Machinery]
- OpenAPI will no longer duplicate these schemas:
  - io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.DeleteOptions_v2
  - io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta_v2
  - io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.OwnerReference_v2
  - io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.StatusDetails_v2
  - io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.Status_v2 ([#110179](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110179), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]

- The kube-proxy `sync_proxy_rules_no_endpoints_total` metric now only counts local-traffic-policy services which have remote endpoints but not local endpoints. ([#109782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109782), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]
- The pod phase lifecycle guarantees that terminal Pods, those whose states are `Unready` or `Succeeded`, can not regress and will have all container stopped. Hence, terminal Pods will never be reachable and should not publish their IP addresses on the `Endpoints` or `EndpointSlices`, independently of the Service `TolerateUnready` option. ([#110255](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110255), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott))
- Updated to cAdvisor v0.44.1 to fix an issue where metrics generated by kubelet for pod network stats were empty in some cases ([#109658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109658), [@bobbypage](https://github.com/bobbypage)) [SIG Node]

The flag "--network-plugin" will no longer be used for new clusters. Stop cleaning up the following dockershim related directories on "kubeadm reset": "/var/lib/dockershim", "/var/runkubernetes", "/var/lib/cni" ([#110022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110022), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
