# Combiner Release Logo

The Kubernetes project itself is made up of many, many individual components that, when combined, take the form of the project you see today. It is also built and maintained by many individuals, all of them with different skills, experiences, histories, and interests, who join forces not just as the release team but as the many SIGs that support the project and the community year-round.

With this release we wish to honor the collaborative, open spirit that takes us from isolated developers, writers, and users spread around the globe to a combined force capable of changing the world. Kubernetes v1.25 includes a staggering 40 enhancements, none of which would exist without the incredible power we have when we work together.

Inspired by our release lead's son, Albert Song, Kubernetes v1.25 is named for each and every one of you, no matter how you choose to contribute your unique power to the combined force that becomes Kubernetes.


Two versions of the logo are provided: the main logo and a small logo. The small logo is intended for use at 128Ã—128 pixels, such as a Slack react. All other uses should use the main logo.

Both are provided in PNG format.
