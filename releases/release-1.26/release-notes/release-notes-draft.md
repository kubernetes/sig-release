## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Deprecated beta APIs scheduled for removal in 1.26 are no longer served. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-26 for more information. ([#111973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111973), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Kube-apiserver: the unused `--master-service-namespace` flag was deprecated and will be removed in v1.27. ([#112797](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112797), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- The `gcp` and `azure` auth plugins have been removed from `client-go` and `kubectl`. See [kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) and [Kubectl Auth Changes in GKE](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) for details about the cloud-specific replacements. ([#112341](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112341), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))

### API Change

- Add `kubernetes_feature_enabled` metric series to track whether each active feature gate is enabled. ([#112690](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112690), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node and Scheduling]
- Add auth API to get self subject attributes (new selfsubjectreviews API is added). 
  The corresponding command for kubctl is provided - `kubectl auth whoami`. ([#111333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111333), [@nabokihms](https://github.com/nabokihms)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, CLI and Testing]
- Clarified the CFS quota as 100ms in the code comments and set the minimum `cpuCFSQuotaPeriod` to 1ms to match Linux kernel expectations. ([#112123](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112123), [@paskal](https://github.com/paskal))
- Component-base: make the validation logic about LeaderElectionConfiguration consistent between component-base and client-go ([#111758](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111758), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG API Machinery and Scheduling]
- Fixed spurious `field is immutable` errors validating updates to Event API ([#112183](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112183), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Introduce v1beta3 for Priority and Fairness with the following changes to the API spec:
  - rename 'assuredConcurrencyShares' (located under spec.limited') to 'nominalConcurrencyShares'
  - apply strategic merge patch annotations to 'Conditions' of flowschemas and prioritylevelconfigurations ([#112306](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112306), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kubelet: changed default value of `cpuCFSQuotaPeriod` from 100ms to 100Âµs to match the Linux CFS and k8s defaults. `cpuCFSQuotaPeriod` of 100ms now requires `customCPUCFSQuotaPeriod` flag to be set to work. ([#111520](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111520), [@paskal](https://github.com/paskal))
- Legacy klog flags are no longer available. Only `-v` and `-vmodule` are still supported. ([#112120](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112120), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Architecture, CLI, Instrumentation, Node and Testing]
- Protobuf serialization of metav1.MicroTime timestamps (used in `Lease` and `Event` API objects) has been corrected to truncate to microsecond precision, to match the documented behavior and JSON/YAML serialization. Any existing persisted data is truncated to microsecond when read from etcd. ([#111936](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111936), [@haoruan](https://github.com/haoruan))
- Reverted regression that prevented `client-go` latency metrics to be reported with a template URL to avoid label cardinality. ([#111752](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111752), [@aanm](https://github.com/aanm))
- The feature gates ServiceLoadBalancerClass and ServiceLBNodePortControl have been removed. These feature gates were enabled (and locked) since v1.24. ([#112577](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112577), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim)) [SIG Apps]

### Feature

- A new --disable-compression flag has been added to kubectl (default = false). When true, it opts out of response compression for all requests to the apiserver. This can help improve list call latencies significantly when client-server network bandwidth is ample (>30MB/s) or if the server is CPU-constrained. ([#112580](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112580), [@shyamjvs](https://github.com/shyamjvs)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- A new `DisableCompression` field (default = `false`) has been added to kubeconfig under cluster info. When set to `true`, clients using the kubeconfig opt out of response compression for all requests to the apiserver. This can help improve list call latencies significantly when client-server network bandwidth is ample (>30MB/s) or if the server is CPU-constrained. ([#112309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112309), [@shyamjvs](https://github.com/shyamjvs))
- A new `pod_status_sync_duration_seconds` histogram is reported at alpha metrics stability that estimates how long the Kubelet takes to write a pod status change once it is detected. ([#107896](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107896), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- API Server tracing root span name for opentelemetry is changed from `KubernetesAPI` to `HTTP GET`. ([#112545](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112545), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- Add new Golang runtime-related metrics to Kubernetes components:
  - go_gc_cycles_automatic_gc_cycles_total
  - go_gc_cycles_forced_gc_cycles_total
  - go_gc_cycles_total_gc_cycles_total
  - go_gc_heap_allocs_by_size_bytes
  - go_gc_heap_allocs_bytes_total
  - go_gc_heap_allocs_objects_total
  - go_gc_heap_frees_by_size_bytes
  - go_gc_heap_frees_bytes_total
  - go_gc_heap_frees_objects_total
  - go_gc_heap_goal_bytes
  - go_gc_heap_objects_objects
  - go_gc_heap_tiny_allocs_objects_total
  - go_gc_pauses_seconds
  - go_memory_classes_heap_free_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_heap_objects_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_heap_released_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_heap_stacks_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_heap_unused_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_metadata_mcache_free_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_metadata_mcache_inuse_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_metadata_mspan_free_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_metadata_mspan_inuse_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_metadata_other_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_os_stacks_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_other_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_profiling_buckets_bytes
  - go_memory_classes_total_bytes
  - go_sched_goroutines_goroutines
  - go_sched_latencies_seconds ([#111910](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111910), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Cloud Provider and Instrumentation]
- Added a new feature gate `CelValidatingAdmissionExtensibility` to enable expression validation for Admission Control. ([#112792](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112792), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added validation for the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag of kubelet to be non-empty. ([#112542](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112542), [@astraw99](https://github.com/astraw99))
- CSRDuration feature gate that graduated to GA in 1.24 and was unconditionally enabled has been removed in v1.26 ([#112386](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112386), [@Shubham82](https://github.com/Shubham82)) [SIG Auth]

- Exposed health check SLI metrics on `metrics/slis` for apiserver. ([#112741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112741), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan))
- Kube-apiserver: `gzip` compression switched from level 4 to level 1 to improve large list call latencies in exchange for higher network bandwidth usage (10-50% higher). This increases the headroom before very large unpaged list calls exceed request timeout limits. ([#112299](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112299), [@shyamjvs](https://github.com/shyamjvs))
- Kubeadm: "show-join-command" has been added as a new separate phase at the end of "kubeadm init". You can skip printing the join information by using "kubeadm init --skip-phases=show-join-command". Executing only this phase on demand will throw an error because the phase needs dependencies such as bootstrap tokens to be pre-populated. ([#111512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111512), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: added the "--cleanup-tmp-dir" flag for `kubeadm reset`. It will cleanup the contents of `/etc/kubernetes/tmp`. The flag is off by default. ([#112172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112172), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave))
- Kubeadm: now supports image repository format validation. ([#112732](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112732), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: sub-phases are now able to support the dry-run mode, e.g. kubeadm reset phase cleanup-node --dry-run ([#112945](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112945), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: try to load CA cert from external CertificateAuthority file when CertificateAuthorityData is empty for existing kubeconfig ([#111783](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111783), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubernetes is now built with Go 1.19.1 ([#112287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112287), [@palnabarun](https://github.com/palnabarun)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Kubernetes is now built with Go 1.19.2 ([#112900](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112900), [@xmudrii](https://github.com/xmudrii)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Scheduler now retries updating a pod's status on ServiceUnavailable and InternalError errors, in addition to net ConnectionRefused error. ([#111809](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111809), [@Huang-Wei](https://github.com/Huang-Wei)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Switch kubectl to use `github.com/russross/blackfriday/v2` ([#112731](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112731), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG CLI]
- The `goroutines` metric is newly added in the scheduler. 
  It replaces `scheduler_goroutines` metric and it counts the number of goroutine in more places than `scheduler_goroutine` does. ([#112003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112003), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- `registered_metric_total` now reports the number of metrics broken down by stability level and deprecated version ([#112907](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112907), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan)) [SIG Architecture and Instrumentation]

### Documentation

- Clarified the default CFS quota period as being 100Âµs and not 100ms. ([#111554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111554), [@paskal](https://github.com/paskal)) [SIG Node]

- Allow Label section in vsphere e2e cloudprovider configuration ([#112427](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112427), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied)) [SIG Storage and Testing]
- Apiserver `/healthz/etcd` endpoint rate limits the number of forwarded health check requests to the etcd backends, answering with the last known state if the rate limit is exceeded. The rate limit is based on 1/2 of the timeout configured, with no burst allowed. ([#112046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112046), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Avoid propagating hosts' `search .` into containers' `/etc/resolv.conf` ([#112157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112157), [@dghubble](https://github.com/dghubble)) [SIG Network and Node]
- Callers using `DelegatingAuthenticationOptions` can now use `DisableAnonymous` to disable Anonymous authentication. ([#112181](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112181), [@xueqzhan](https://github.com/xueqzhan))

- Etcd: Updated to v3.5.5. ([#112489](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112489), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- Fix relative cpu priority for pods where containers explicitly request zero cpu by giving the lowest priority instead of falling back to the cpu limit to avoid possible cpu starvation of other pods ([#108832](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108832), [@waynepeking348](https://github.com/waynepeking348)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed an ephemeral port exhaustion bug caused by improper connection management that occurred when a large number of objects were handled by `kubectl` while exec auth was in use. ([#112017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112017), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))
- Fixed an issue in `winkernel` proxier that causes proxy rules to leak anytime service backends are modified. ([#112837](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112837), [@daschott](https://github.com/daschott))
- Fixed bug in `kubectl rollout history` where only the latest revision was displayed when a specific revision was requested and an output format was specified. ([#111093](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111093), [@brianpursley](https://github.com/brianpursley))

- Fixed race condition in GCE between containerized mounter setup in the kubelet. ([#112195](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112195), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
- For raw block CSI volumes on Kubernetes, kubelet was incorrectly calling CSI `NodeStageVolume` for every single "map" (i.e. raw block "mount") operation for a volume already attached to the node. This change modified that behavior to ensure it is only called once per volume per node. ([#112403](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112403), [@akankshakumari393](https://github.com/akankshakumari393))
- Improved `kubectl` display of invalid request errors returned by the API server. ([#112150](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112150), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Increased the maximum backoff delay of the endpointslice controller to match the expected sequence of delays when syncing Services. ([#112353](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112353), [@dgrisonnet](https://github.com/dgrisonnet))
- Kube-apiserver: redirect responses are no longer returned from backends by default. Set `--aggregator-reject-forwarding-redirect=false` to continue forwarding redirect responses. ([#112193](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112193), [@jindijamie](https://github.com/jindijamie)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: redirects from backend API servers are no longer followed when checking availability with requests to `/apis/$group/$version` ([#112772](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112772), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: resolved a regression that treated `304 Not Modified` responses from aggregated API servers as internal errors. ([#112526](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112526), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-apiserver: x-kubernetes-list-type validation is now enforced when updating status of custom resources ([#111866](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111866), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kube-proxy no longer falls back from ipvs mode to iptables mode if you ask it to do ipvs but the system is not correctly configured. Instead, it will just exit with an error. ([#111806](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111806), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]
- Kube-scheduler: added taints filtering logic consistent with `TaintToleration` plugin for `PodTopologySpread` plugin. ([#112357](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112357), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm will cleanup the stale data on best effort basis. Stale data will be removed when each reset phase are executed, default etcd data directory will be cleanup when the `remove-etcd-member` phase are executed. ([#110972](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110972), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: allow RSA and ECDSA format keys in preflight check ([#112508](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112508), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: fixed a bug when performing validation on `ClusterConfiguration` networking fields. ([#112751](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112751), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: when a sub command is needed but not provided for a kubeadm command, print a help screen instead of showing a short message. ([#111277](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111277), [@chymy](https://github.com/chymy))
- Kubelet now cleans up the Node's cloud node IP annotation correctly if you
  stop using `--node-ip`. (In particular, this fixes the problem where people who
  were unnecessarily using `--node-ip` with an external cloud provider in 1.23,
  and then running into problems with 1.24, could not fix the problem by just
  removing the unnecessary `--node-ip` from the kubelet arguments, because
  that wouldn't remove the annotation that caused the problems.) ([#112184](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112184), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network and Node]
- Kubelet: fixed log spam from kubelet_getters.go `Path does not exist`. ([#112650](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112650), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips))
- Kubelet: when there are multi option lines in /etc/resolv.conf, merge all options into one line in a pod with the `Default` DNS policy. ([#112414](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112414), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Network and Node]
- Log messages and metrics for the watch cache are now keyed by `<resource>.<group>` instead of `go` struct type. This means e.g. that `*v1.Pod` becomes `pods`. Additionally, resources that come from CustomResourceDefinitions are now displayed as the correct resource and group, instead of `*unstructured.Unstructured`. ([#111807](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111807), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Moved `LocalStorageCapacityIsolationFSQuotaMonitoring` back to Alpha. ([#112076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112076), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips))
- Pod failed in scheduling due to expected error will be updated with the reason of `SchedulerError` rather than `Unschedulable`. ([#111999](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111999), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
- Services of type LoadBalancer create fewer AWS security group rules in most cases ([#112267](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112267), [@sjenning](https://github.com/sjenning)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- The errors in `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/meta` now support for the `stdlibs` `errors.Is` matching, including when wrapped. ([#111808](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111808), [@alvaroaleman](https://github.com/alvaroaleman))
- The metrics `etcd_request_duration_seconds` and `etcd_bookmark_counts` now differentiate by group resource instead of object type, allowing unique entries per `CustomResourceDefinition`, instead of grouping them all under `*unstructured.Unstructured`. ([#112042](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112042), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))
- The pod admission error message was improved for usability. ([#112644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112644), [@vitorfhc](https://github.com/vitorfhc)) [SIG Node]
- Updated the system-validators library to v1.8.0 ([#112026](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112026), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Volume mount cleanup now considers only plugin directory and not the entire kubelet root ([#112607](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112607), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Added a `kubernetes_feature_enabled` metric which will tell you if a feature is enabled. ([#112652](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112652), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan))
- E2e: tests can now register callbacks with `ginkgo.BeforeEach`, `ginkgo.AfterEach` or `ginkgo.DeferCleanup` directly after creating a framework instance and are guaranteed that their code is called after the framework is initialized and before it gets cleaned up. `ginkgo.DeferCleanup` replaces `f.AddAfterEach` and `AddCleanupAction` which got removed to simplify the framework. ([#111998](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111998), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Introduce `ComponentSLIs` alpha feature-gate for component SLIs metrics endpoint. ([#112884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112884), [@logicalhan](https://github.com/logicalhan)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kube scheduler Component Config release version v1beta3 is deprecated in v1.26 and will be removed in v1.29, 
  also v1beta2 will be removed in v1.28. ([#112257](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112257), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kube-scheduler: the `DefaultPodTopologySpread`, `NonPreemptingPriority`, `PodAffinityNamespaceSelector` and `PreferNominatedNode` feature gates that graduated to GA in v1.24 and were unconditionally enabled have been removed in v1.26. ([#112567](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112567), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: removed the toleration for the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` taint from the CoreDNS deployment of `kubeadm`. With the 1.25 release of kubeadm the taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` is no longer applied to control plane nodes and the toleration for it can be removed with the release of 1.26. You can also perform the same toleration removal from your own addon manifests. ([#112008](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112008), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Kubeadm: removed the usage of the `--container-runtime=remote` flag for the kubelet during kubeadm init/join/upgrade. The flag value `remote` had been the only possible value since `dockershim` was removed from the kubelet. ([#112000](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112000), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Locked `ServerSideApply` feature gate to true with the feature already being GA. ([#112748](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112748), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t))
