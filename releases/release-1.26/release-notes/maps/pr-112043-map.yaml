  text: Refactored `test/e2e/framework` so that the core framework is smaller. Optional
    functionality like resource monitoring, log size monitoring, metrics gathering
    and debug information dumping must be imported by specific e2e test suites. Init
    packages are provided which can be imported to re-enable the functionality that
    traditionally was in the core framework. If you have code that no longer compiles
    because of this PR, you can use the script [from a commit message](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112043/commits/dfdf88d4faafa6fd39988832ea0ef6d668f490e9)
    to update that code.
