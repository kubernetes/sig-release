    'Graduated `JobTrackingWithFinalizers` to stable.
    Jobs created before the feature was enabled are still tracked without finalizers.
    Jobs tracked with finalizers have the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking.
    If the annotation is present and the user attempts to remove it, the control plane adds it back.
    The annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking` is now deprecated.
    The control plane will ignore it and stop adding it for new Jobs in v1.27.'
