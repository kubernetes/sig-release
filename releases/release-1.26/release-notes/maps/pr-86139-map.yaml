    'Container `preStop` and `postStart` lifecycle handlers using `httpGet` now
    honor the specified `scheme` and `headers` fields. This enables setting custom
    headers and changing the scheme to `HTTPS`, consistent with container
    startup/readiness/liveness probe capabilities. Lifecycle handlers configured
    with `scheme: HTTPS` that encounter errors indicating the endpoint is actually
    using HTTP fall back to making the request over HTTP for compatibility with
    previous releases. When this happens, a `LifecycleHTTPFallback` event is recorded
    in the namespace of the pod and a `kubelet_lifecycle_handler_http_fallbacks_total`
    metric in the kubelet is incremented. Cluster administrators can opt out of the
    expanded lifecycle handler capabilities by setting
    `--feature-gates=ConsistentHTTPGetHandlers=false` in `kubelet`.'
