  text: A new `DisableCompression` field (default = `false`) has been added to
    kubeconfig under cluster info. When set to `true`, clients using the kubeconfig
    opt out of response compression for all requests to the apiserver. This can
    help improve list call latencies significantly when client-server network
    bandwidth is ample (>30MB/s) or if the server is CPU-constrained.
