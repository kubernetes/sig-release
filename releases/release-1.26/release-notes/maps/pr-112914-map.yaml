  text: Added a `--topology-manager-policy-options` flag to the kubelet to support
    fine tuning the topology manager policies. The first policy option, `prefer-closest-numa-nodes`,
    allows these policies to favor sets of NUMA nodes with shorter distance between
    nodes when making admission decisions.
