  text: 'kubeadm: removed the toleration for the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`
    taint from the CoreDNS deployment of `kubeadm`. With the 1.25 release of kubeadm
    the taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` is no longer applied to control plane
    nodes and the toleration for it can be removed with the release of 1.26. You can
    also perform the same toleration removal from your own addon manifests.'
