    '`PodDisruptionBudget` now adds an alpha `spec.unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` field.
    When the `PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` feature-gate is enabled in `kube-apiserver`,
    setting this field to `"AlwaysAllow"` allows pods to be evicted if they do not
    have a ready condition, regardless of whether the PodDisruptionBudget is currently
    healthy.'
