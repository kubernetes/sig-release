  text: Protobuf serialization of metav1.MicroTime timestamps (used in `Lease` and
    `Event` API objects) has been corrected to truncate to microsecond precision,
    to match the documented behavior and JSON/YAML serialization. Any existing persisted
    data is truncated to microsecond when read from etcd.
