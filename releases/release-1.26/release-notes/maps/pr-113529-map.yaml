  text: A new API server flag `--encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload` was
    added to control when the encryption config should be automatically reloaded without
    needing to restart the server.  All KMS plugins are now merged into a single healthz
    check at `/healthz/kms-providers` when reload is enabled, or when only KMS v2
    plugins are used.
