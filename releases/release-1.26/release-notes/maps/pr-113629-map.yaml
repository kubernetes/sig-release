    'Promoted the `APIServerIdentity` feature to Beta. By default, each `kube-apiserver`
    will now create a Lease in the `kube-system` namespace. These lease objects can
    be used to identify the number of active API servers in the cluster, and may also
    be used for future features such as the Storage Version API.'
