    'Added a `ResourceClaim` API (in the `resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API group and
    behind the `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate).
    The new API is now more flexible than the existing Device Plugins feature of Kubernetes because it
    allows Pods to request (claim) special kinds of resources, which can be available at node level, cluster
    level, or following any other model you implement.'
