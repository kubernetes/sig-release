    Kubeadm: Added the `--allow-deprecated-api` flag to `kubeadm config validate`. By default the command prints a warning for deprecated APIs unless the flag is passed. Additionally, added missing support for `v1beta4` `UpgradeConfiguration` to `kubeadm config migrate` and `kubeadm config validate` commands.
