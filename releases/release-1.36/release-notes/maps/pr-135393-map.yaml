    Added support for running PreBind plugins in parallel in the scheduler framework to improve binding latency.
    Action Required: Plugins can opt-in to parallel execution by returning `AllowParallel: true` from the `PreBindPreFlight` method. PreBind plugin implementations need to be updated to return `PreBindPreFlightResult` from the `PreBindPreFlight` method; returning nil retains the existing sequential behavior.
