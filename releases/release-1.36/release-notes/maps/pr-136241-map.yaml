    Fixed an issue in the Windows `kube-proxy` (winkernel) where IPv4 and IPv6 Service load balancers could be incorrectly shared, causing broken dual-stack Service behavior. The `kube-proxy` now tracks load balancers per IP family, enabling correct support for `PreferDualStack` and `RequireDualStack` Services on Windows nodes.
