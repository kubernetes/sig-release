    Fixed a bug in `DeepEqualWithNilDifferentFromEmpty` where empty slices and maps were incorrectly considered equal to non-empty ones due to using OR (`||`) instead of AND (`&&`) logic. This could cause managed fields timestamps to not update when the only change was adding or removing all elements from a list or map.
