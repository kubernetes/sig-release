## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Added support for running PreBind plugins in parallel in the scheduler framework to improve binding latency.
  Action Required: Plugins can opt-in to parallel execution by returning `AllowParallel: true` from the `PreBindPreFlight` method. PreBind plugin implementations need to be updated to return `PreBindPreFlightResult` from the `PreBindPreFlight` method; returning nil retains the existing sequential behavior. ([#135393](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135393), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
 - Extended PostFilterResult with a list of Pods that the PostFilter plugin preempted.
  PostFilter plugin implementations need to be updated to return the preempted Pods (if any) in the PostFilterResult from the PostFilter method; returning nil means the plugin did not preempt any Pods at all. ([#136254](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136254), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k)) [SIG Scheduling]
 - Kubeadm: removed the integrated support for flex-volumes in kubeadm. Users were advised to migrate away from flex-volumes as recommended by SIG Storage, since 1.22. If kubeadm users wish to continue using the feature, they would need a custom image for the KCM that is not based on distroless, pass the KCM flag `--flex-volume-plugin-dir` and mount the directory `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec` in the KCM static pod using kubeadm's `extraVolumes` mechanism before upgrading to 1.36. Up until now, kubeadm automatically did the mounting if the user passed the flag.

- Fixed an issue in kube-apiserver, allowing it to recover from an established connection to an incorrect server that never returns the expected response during APIService availability checks. ([#137157](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137157), [@bsalamat](https://github.com/bsalamat)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Generated `fake.NewClientset` which replaces the deprecated `NewSimpleClientset` for `kube-aggregator` and `sample-apiserver`. ([#136537](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136537), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- Graduated MutatingAdmissionPolicy to GA (v1) in Kubernetes 1.36. The feature is now enabled by default. ([#136039](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136039), [@lalitc375](https://github.com/lalitc375)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Etcd and Testing]
- Introduced stability-based lifecycle for declarative validation (Alpha/Beta/Stable). Scheduling Workload v1alpha1 now uses explicit declarative enforcement. ([#136793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136793), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery and Scheduling]
- K8s.io/api: REST API types no longer implement marker `ProtoMessage()` methods, identifying them as standard v1 proto messages. Protobuf serialization of Kubernetes API types should use [k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/protobuf](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/protobuf). See [KEP-5589](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5589-gogo-dependency) for more details. ([#137084](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137084), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Storage]

- Kube-controller-manager: alpha gauge metrics for informer queue length are now published as `informer_queued_items{name=kube-controller-manager,group=<group>,resource=<resource>,version=<version>} <count>` ([#135782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135782), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Locked the `VolumeAttributesClass` feature gate to `true` and updated the preferred storage version to `storage.k8s.io/v1`. ([#134556](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134556), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Etcd, Network, Node, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Marked the `endpoints` field as optional in the OpenAPI spec for `discovery.k8s.io/v1` EndpointSlice. This matches server behavior and resolves validation issues. ([#136111](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136111), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Pod Certificates (beta) now includes a PKCS#10 certificate signing request for wider compatibility with existing certificate authority software. ([#136729](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136729), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Promoted several component-base metrics (`kubernetes_build_info`, `rest_client_requests_total`, `rest_client_request_duration_seconds`, `running_managed_controllers`) from Alpha to Beta stability, providing stronger API and label stability guarantees for consumers. ([#136154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136154), [@bhope](https://github.com/bhope)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]

- Promoted workqueue metrics from ALPHA to BETA. ([#135522](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135522), [@petern48](https://github.com/petern48)) [SIG Architecture, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Removed the in-tree Portworx volume plugin, completing the migration to CSI.
  Removed the GA `CSIMigrationPortworx` feature gate (locked since `v1.33`) and alpha `InTreePluginPortworxUnregister` feature gate, with all operations now redirected to CSI. ([#135322](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135322), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Replace deprecated sets.String with sets.Set[string] in apiserver admission subsystem. This is a breaking change for consumers of the NewLifecycle function. ([#134044](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134044), [@mcallzbl](https://github.com/mcallzbl)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]

### Feature

- Add an alpha informer_processing_latency_seconds histogram metric to measure event handler execution time in RealFIFO. ([#137101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137101), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Add the kubelet_metrics_provider metric to help users identify where kubelet's metrics are coming from. ([#136952](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136952), [@dgrisonnet](https://github.com/dgrisonnet)) [SIG Node]
- Added ALPHA counter metric `scheduler_pod_scheduled_after_flush_total` to track pods successfully scheduled after timeout flush from the `unschedulablePods` queue. ([#135126](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135126), [@mrvarmazyar](https://github.com/mrvarmazyar))
- Added `ARCH` column in the `kubectl get node -o wide` output. ([#132402](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132402), [@astraw99](https://github.com/astraw99))
- Added `kubectl explain -r` flag as a shorthand for `--recursive`. ([#135283](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135283), [@laervn](https://github.com/laervn))
- Added a show-secret flag to the diff command to explicitly allow secret values to be displayed during the diff operation. ([#137019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137019), [@olamilekan000](https://github.com/olamilekan000)) [SIG CLI]
- Added alpha counter metric `route_controller_route_sync_total` to Cloud Controller Manager to track route syncs with cloud providers. This metric is in alpha stage. ([#136539](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136539), [@lukasmetzner](https://github.com/lukasmetzner)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Instrumentation]
- Added support for unknown (non-pod) references in `ResourceClaim` `status.reservedFor`. The controller now gracefully skips these entries instead of halting sync, ensuring stale pod references can still be cleaned up. ([#136450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136450), [@MohammedSaalif](https://github.com/MohammedSaalif)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Added the `appProtocol` field to `kubectl describe service` output. ([#135744](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135744), [@ali-a-a](https://github.com/ali-a-a))
- Added write and read permissions for workloads to the `admin` cluster role, write permissions to the `edit` cluster role, and read permissions to the `view` cluster role. ([#135418](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135418), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Adds alpha metrics `apiserver_peer_proxy_errors_total` and `apiserver_peer_discovery_sync_errors_total` to apiserver to track errors encountered in peer proxying and peer discovery ([#137065](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137065), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Aligned the `scheduler_preemption_victims` metric definition between asynchronous and synchronous preemption modes. The metric now consistently reports the number of pods chosen as victims across both modes. ([#135955](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135955), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k))
- Changed the default debug profile from `legacy` to `general`. The `legacy` profile is planned to be removed in `v1.39`. ([#135874](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135874), [@mochizuki875](https://github.com/mochizuki875)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Client-go: Default informer behavior now updates store state with all the objects in a list or relist before calling handler `OnDelete`, `OnAdd`, or `OnUpdate` methods for individual items which were deleted, added, or removed. This ensures that the store state which can be inspected by handlers corresponds to a set of objects that existed at a particular resource version on the server. This behavior is guarded by the `AtomicFIFO` feature gate, which is enabled by default in `v1.36` but can be disabled if needed to temporarily regain the previous behavior. ([#135462](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135462), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Client-go: Improved informer resync processing to reduce contention on store locks between incoming events and handler updates, which may result in observable timing differences of handler invocations. This behavior is guarded by the `AtomicFIFO` feature gate, which is enabled by default in `v1.36` but can be disabled if needed to temporarily regain the previous behavior. ([#136008](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136008), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Client-go: Informers can now enqueue new watch events while already-queued events are being processed. This avoids dropping watches during a burst of incoming events due to contention on slow processing. This behavior is controlled by the `UnlockWhileProcessing` client-go feature gate, which is enabled by default. ([#136264](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136264), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery and Scheduling]
- Client-go: informer stores now keep track the resourceVersion they are synced to (via add/update/delete events, or replace calls, or bookmark events), and provide a `LastStoreSyncResourceVersion` method to obtain this resource version. This method can return `""` if the store has not been synced to yet, and depends on the AtomicFIFO feature being enabled. ([#134827](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134827), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) validation now strictly enforces ranges for numeric formats (`int32`, `int64`, `float`, `double`) when specified in the schema. Existing objects with out-of-range values are preserved via validation ratcheting. ([#136582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136582), [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- Enabled the `WatchCacheInitializationPostStartHook` feature gate by default. ([#135777](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135777), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Graduated fine-grained kubelet API authorization to stable. ([#136116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136116), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG Node]
- Introduced PodGroup scheduling cycle in kube-scheduler to schedule entire PodGroup in one cycle. ([#136618](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136618), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- K8s.io/cloud-provider: Adds missing TLS flags to webhook serving options ([#136816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136816), [@damdo](https://github.com/damdo)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature gate to GA. ([#136118](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136118), [@HarshalNeelkamal](https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kube-controller-manager: The daemonset controller now defers syncing a DaemonSet object when the controller has not yet observed daemonset or pod writes from the last time the object was synced. This prevents spurious creation of duplicate pods for nodes when the controller's cache is stale. When a sync is deferred for this reason, a `daemonset_controller_stale_sync_skips_total` metric is incremented and a message is logged by the daemonset controller. This behavior can be temporarily disabled by setting the `StaleControllerConsistencyDaemonSet` feature gate to false. ([#134937](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134937), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Kube-controller-manager: The job controller now defers syncing a Job object when the controller has not yet observed job or pod writes from the last time the object was synced. This prevents spurious creation of duplicate pods for jobs when the controller's cache is stale. When a sync is deferred for this reason, a `job_controller_stale_sync_skips_total` metric is incremented and a message is logged by the job controller. This behavior can be temporarily disabled by setting the `StaleControllerConsistencyJob` feature gate to false. ([#137210](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137210), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Kubeadm: Added the `--allow-deprecated-api` flag to `kubeadm config validate`. By default the command prints a warning for deprecated APIs unless the flag is passed. Additionally, added missing support for `v1beta4` `UpgradeConfiguration` to `kubeadm config migrate` and `kubeadm config validate` commands. ([#135148](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135148), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Changed Node object patching behavior to retry on unknown (non-allowlisted) API errors within the polling duration instead of exiting early. ([#135776](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135776), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Increased the timeout of the `kubeadm upgrade` `CreateJob` preflight check to 1 minute. This allows Windows worker nodes to have more time to run the preflight check. The check uses the `pause` image, so if you are experiencing slow pull times, you can either pre-pull the image on the worker using `kubeadm config images pull --kubernetes-version TARGET` or skip the preflight check with `--ignore-preflight-errors`. ([#136273](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136273), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Promoted the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate to GA and locked it to enabled. ([#135742](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135742), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi))
- Kubeadm: Removed the `ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode` feature gate, which graduated to GA in `v1.35` and was locked to enabled. ([#135773](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135773), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: the preflight check `ContainerRuntimeVersion` validates if the installed container runtime supports the `RuntimeConfig` gRPC method. For older kubelet versions than 1.37, it will return a preflight warning. ([#136898](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136898), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kubelet: defer the configurations flags (and the related fallback behavior) deprecation removal timeline from 1.36 to 1.37 to align with containerd v1.7 support ([#136846](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136846), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node and Testing]

- Fixed StatefulSets to always count `.status.availableReplicas` at the correct time without delay, resulting in faster StatefulSet rollout progress. ([#135428](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135428), [@atiratree](https://github.com/atiratree))
- Fixed `ReadWriteOncePod` preemption e2e test to run as serial, preventing it from causing other random e2e tests to flake. ([#135623](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135623), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG Storage and Testing]

- Fixed a `v1.34` regression in `ipvs` and `winkernel` `kube-proxy` backends. These backends now revert to their `pre-v1.34` behavior of regularly rechecking all rules even when no Services or EndpointSlices change. ([#135631](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135631), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network and Windows]

- Fixed a bug in `DeepEqualWithNilDifferentFromEmpty` where empty slices and maps were incorrectly considered equal to non-empty ones due to using OR (`||`) instead of AND (`&&`) logic. This could cause managed fields timestamps to not update when the only change was adding or removing all elements from a list or map. ([#135636](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135636), [@mikecook](https://github.com/mikecook))
- Fixed a bug in the `dra_operations_duration_seconds` metric where the `is_error` label was recording inverted values. Error operations now correctly report `is_error=true`, and successful operations report `is_error=false`. ([#135227](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135227), [@hime](https://github.com/hime))

- Fixed a race condition in CEL admission policy compilation that could cause `kube-apiserver` to crash with a `concurrent map read and map write` error under high load. ([#135759](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135759), [@Abhigyan-Shekhar](https://github.com/Abhigyan-Shekhar)) [SIG API Machinery and CLI]
- Fixed a race condition in Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) where the same device could be allocated twice for different `ResourceClaims` when scheduling many pods very rapidly. Depending on whether DRA drivers check for this during `NodePrepareResources` (they should, but not all may implement this properly), the second pod using the same device could fail to start until the first one is done or (worse) run in parallel. ([#136269](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136269), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Fixed an issue in the Windows `kube-proxy` (winkernel) where IPv4 and IPv6 Service load balancers could be incorrectly shared, causing broken dual-stack Service behavior. The `kube-proxy` now tracks load balancers per IP family, enabling correct support for `PreferDualStack` and `RequireDualStack` Services on Windows nodes. ([#136241](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136241), [@princepereira](https://github.com/princepereira)) [SIG Network and Windows]

- Fixed issues in server side apply and client-go's `Extract{TypeName}()` and `Extract{TypeName}From()` functions where empty arrays and maps were incorrectly treated as absent, and atomic elements from associative lists were incorrectly duplicated. ([#135391](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135391), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Network, Node, Scheduling and Storage]

- Kube-apiserver: Fixed request latency annotation `apiserver.latency.k8s.io/total` in the audit log when request took more than `500ms`. ([#135685](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135685), [@chaochn47](https://github.com/chaochn47))
- Kube-apiserver: Fixed the log verbosity level in the unsafe delete authorization check that was incorrectly using Error level instead of Info level. ([#136229](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136229), [@thc1006](https://github.com/thc1006))
- Kube-apiserver: Liveness probes will now fail when the loopback client certificate expires. ([#136477](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136477), [@everettraven](https://github.com/everettraven)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Setting `--audit-log-maxsize=0` now disables audit log rotation (the default remains `100 MB`). To avoid outages due to filling disks with ever-growing audit logs, `--audit-log-maxage` now defaults to `366 (1 year)` and `--audit-log-maxbackup` now defaults to `100`. If retention of all rotated logs is desired, age and count-based pruning can be disabled by explicitly specifying `--audit-log-maxage=0` and `--audit-log-maxbackup=0`. ([#136478](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136478), [@kairosci](https://github.com/kairosci))

- Kubeadm: Fixed a bug where `kubeadm upgrade` failed if the content of the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file was `KUBELET_KUBEADM_ARGS=""`. ([#136127](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136127), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kubeadm: When applying user-provided overrides using `extraArgs`, the resulting list of arguments is no longer sorted alphanumerically. Only default arguments are sorted, while overrides preserve their order. This allows finer control for flags where order matters, such as `--service-account-issuer` for `kube-apiserver`. ([#135400](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135400), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))

- Kubelet: Fixed a nil pointer dereference when handling pod updates of mirror pods with the `NodeDeclaredFeatures` feature gate enabled. ([#136037](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136037), [@pravk03](https://github.com/pravk03))
- Kubelet: Fixed logging to properly respect verbosity levels. Previously, some debug/info messages using `V().Error()` would always be printed regardless of the configured log verbosity. ([#136028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136028), [@thc1006](https://github.com/thc1006))
- Kubelet: Fixed reloading of server certificate files when they are changed on disk and kubelet is dialed by IP address instead of DNS/hostname. ([#133654](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133654), [@kwohlfahrt](https://github.com/kwohlfahrt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Kubelet: The plugin manager now properly handles plugin registration failures by removing failed plugins from the actual state and retrying with exponential backoff (initial delay `500ms`, doubling each failure up to `~2 minutes` maximum) to protect against broken plugins causing denial of service while still allowing recovery from transient failures. ([#133335](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133335), [@bart0sh](https://github.com/bart0sh)) [SIG Node, Storage and Testing]
- Optimized kube-proxy conntrack cleanup logic, reducing the time complexity of deleting stale UDP entries. This significantly improves performance when there are many stale connections to clean up. ([#135511](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135511), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network]
- Sorted runtime handlers list from the CRI runtime to prevent unnecessary Node object updates when the order changes. ([#135358](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135358), [@harche](https://github.com/harche))
- The metrics `container_cpu_load_average_10s`, `container_cpu_load_d_average_10s`, and `cpu_tasks_state` have been dropped from the reported metrics by cadvisor. This is done because the values were always 0, because a flag was not enabled in the kubelet. ([#134981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134981), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Updated `NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation` scoring algorithm to align with the documentation. The score will now take into consideration both balance with and without the requested pod.

([#135573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135573), [@brejman](https://github.com/brejman)) [SIG Scheduling]

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Added `audit-id` to the "Starting watch" log line. ([#136084](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136084), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker))
- Added explicit logging when `WatchList` requests complete their initial listing phase. ([#136085](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136085), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker))
- Added missing tests for client-go metrics. ([#136052](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136052), [@sreeram-venkitesh](https://github.com/sreeram-venkitesh)) [SIG Architecture and Instrumentation]
- Apiserver_rerouted_request_total metric will expose labels for group, version and resource. ([#137063](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137063), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Client-go: Fake client-go (i.e., anything using `k8s.io/client-go/testing`) now supports separate List+Watch calls with checking of `ResourceVersion` in the Watch call. This closes a race condition where creating an object directly after an informer cache has synced (List call completed) and before the Watch call completed would cause that object to not be sent to the informer. A visible side-effect of adding that support is that List metadata contains a `ResourceVersion` (starting at 1 for the empty set, incremented by one for each add/update) and that Watch may return objects where it previously did not.
  Note that this List+Watch is not to be confused with the `ListWatch` feature, which uses a single call. That feature is still not supported by fake client-go. ([#136143](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136143), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and CLI]
- Client-go: Fixed an issue where Reflector could get confused about the resource version it should use to restart a watch while receiving synthetic ADDED events at the beginning of a watch from `resourceVersion` 0 or empty string (`""`). ([#136583](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136583), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Enabled YAML support for `/statusz` and `/flagz` endpoints. ([#135309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135309), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Fixed DRA device taint eviction controller to avoid confusing intermediate status messages by delaying status updates after pod eviction until the informer cache is updated. ([#135611](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135611), [@Karthik-K-N](https://github.com/Karthik-K-N)) [SIG Apps and Scheduling]
- Kubeadm: Removed the cleanup of the `--pod-infra-container-image` kubelet flag from `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` on upgrade. This cleanup was necessary when upgrading to `v1.35`. ([#135807](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135807), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))
- Kubeadm: Removed usage of the deprecated `etcd` flags `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` and `--experimental-watch-progress-notify-interval` if the `etcd` version is < `v3.6.0`. In this version of kubeadm, `etcd` < `v3.6.0` is no longer supported in terms of the Kubernetes / `etcd` version mapping. These deprecated flags have been replaced by `--feature-gates=InitialCorruptCheck=true` and `--watch-progress-notify-interval`. ([#135701](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135701), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubelet: Fixed admission to correctly handle DRA-backed extended resources, allowing Pods to be admitted even when these resources are not present in the node's allocatable capacity.

- Promoted `InOrderInformers` to GA via the usage of `RealFIFO`. This means that `DeltaFIFO` will gradually be deprecated in favor of `RealFIFO` in internal implementations. ([#136601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136601), [@michaelasp](https://github.com/michaelasp))
- Removed event listing behavior when describing a deleted Pod from file using `kubectl describe -f`, ensuring consistent NotFound error handling across all resource types. ([#135281](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135281), [@scaliby](https://github.com/scaliby))
- Removed the `WatchFromStorageWithoutResourceVersion` feature gate in `v1.36`. ([#136066](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136066), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Removed the generally available feature gate `HonorPVReclaimPolicy`, which was locked and enabled since 1.33. ([#135335](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135335), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Apps and Storage]
- Renamed `PodGroupInfo` to `PodGroupState`, which may break custom scheduler plugins that use `Handle.WorkloadManager`. ([#136344](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136344), [@brejman](https://github.com/brejman))
- The deprecated SeparateCacheWatchRPC feature gate is now locked to its default value (false) and can no longer be overridden. The feature gate will be removed in a future release.
