  text: Add 2 new options for kube-proxy running in winkernel mode. `--forward-healthcheck-vip`,
    if specified as true, health check traffic whose destination is service VIP will
    be forwarded to kube-proxy's healthcheck service. `--root-hnsendpoint-name` specifies
    the name of the hns endpoint for the root network namespace. This option enables
    the pass-through load balancers like Google's GCLB to correctly health check the
    backend services. Without this change, the health check packets is dropped, and
    Windows node will be considered to be unhealthy by those load balancers.
