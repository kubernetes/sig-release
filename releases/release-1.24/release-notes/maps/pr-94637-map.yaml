  text: 'kube-apiserver: ensures the namespace of objects sent to admission webhooks
    matches the request namespace. Previously, objects without a namespace set would
    have the request namespace populated after mutating admission, and objects with
    a namespace that did not match the request namespace would be rejected after admission.'
