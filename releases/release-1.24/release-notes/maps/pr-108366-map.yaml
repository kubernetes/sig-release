  text: Fixed a regression that could incorrectly reject pods with `OutOfCpu` errors
    if they were rapidly scheduled after other pods were reported as complete in the
    API. The Kubelet now waits to report the phase of a pod as terminal in the API
    until all running containers are guaranteed to have stopped and no new containers
    can be started.  Short-lived pods may take slightly longer (~1s) to report Succeeded
    or Failed after this change.
