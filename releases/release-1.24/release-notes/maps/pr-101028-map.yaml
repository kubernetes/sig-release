  text: Fixed bug with leads to Node goes `Not-ready` state when credentials for vCenter
    stored in a secret and Zones feature is in use. Zone labels setup moved to KCM
    component, kubelet skips this step during startup in such case. If credentials
    stored in cloud-provider config file as plaintext current behaviour does not change
    and no action required. For proper functioning `kube-system:vsphere-legacy-cloud-provider`
    should be allowed to update node object if vCenter credentials stored in secret
    and Zone feature used.
