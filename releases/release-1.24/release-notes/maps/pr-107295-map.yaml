  text: "kubeadm: make sure that `kubeadm init/join` always use a URL scheme (unix://
    on Linux and npipe:// on Windows) when passing a value to the `--container-runtime-endpoint`
    kubelet flag. This flag's value is taken from the kubeadm configuration `criSocket`
    field or the `--cri-socket` CLI flag. Automatically add a missing URL scheme to
    the user configuration in memory, but warn them that they should also update their
    configuration on disk manually. During `kubeadm upgrade apply/node` mutate the
    `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on disk and the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket`
    annotation Node object if needed. These automatic actions are temporary and will
    be removed in a future release. In the future the kubelet may not support CRI
    endpoints without an URL scheme."
