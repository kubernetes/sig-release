  text: Kubernetes 1.24 bumped version of golang it is compiled with to go1.18, which
    introduced significant changes to its garbage collection algorithm. As a result,
    we observed an increase in memory usage for kube-apiserver in larger an heavily
    loaded clusters up to ~25% (with the benefit of API call latencies drop by up
    to 10x on 99th percentiles). If the memory increase is not acceptable for you
    you can mitigate by setting GOGC env variable (for our tests using GOGC=63 brings
    memory usage back to original value, although the exact value may depend on usage
    patterns on your cluster).
