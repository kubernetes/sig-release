  text: Omit enum declarations from the static openapi file captured at https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/api/openapi-spec.
    This file is used to generate API clients, and use of enums in those generated
    clients (rather than strings) can break forward compatibility with additional
    future values in those fields. See https://issue.k8s.io/109177 for details.
