  text: 'kubeadm: apply `second stage` of the plan to migrate kubeadm away from the
    usage of the word `master` in labels and taints. For new clusters, the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`
    will no longer be added to control plane nodes, only the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane`
    will be added. For clusters that are being upgraded to 1.24 with `kubeadm upgrade
    apply`, the command will remove the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` from
    existing control plane nodes. For new clusters, both the old taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule`
    and new taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` will be added
    to control plane nodes. In release 1.20 (`first stage`), a release note instructed
    to preemptively tolerate the new taint. For clusters that are being upgraded to
    1.24 with `kubeadm upgrade apply`, the command will add the new taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule`
    to existing control plane nodes. Please adapt your infrastructure to these changes.
    In 1.25 the old taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` will be removed.'
