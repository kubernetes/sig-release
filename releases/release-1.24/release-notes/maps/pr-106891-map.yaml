  text: 'kubeadm: during execution of the `certs check-expiration` command, treat the etcd
    CA as external if there is a missing etcd CA key file (etcd/ca.key) and perform
    the proper validation on certificates signed by the etcd CA. Additionally, make
    sure that the CA for all entries in the output table is included - for both certificates
    on disk and in kubeconfig files.'
