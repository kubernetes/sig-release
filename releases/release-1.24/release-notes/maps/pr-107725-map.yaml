  text: 'kubeadm: improve the strict parsing of user YAML/JSON configuration files.
    Next to printing warnings for unknown and duplicate fields (current state), also
    print warnings for fields with incorrect case sensitivity - e.g. `controlPlaneEndpoint`
    (valid), `ControlPlaneEndpoint` (invalid). Instead of only printing warnings during
    `init` and `join` also print warnings when downloading the ClusterConfiguration,
    KubeletConfiguration or KubeProxyConfiguration objects from the cluster. This
    can be useful if the user has patched these objects in their respective ConfigMaps
    with mistakes.'
