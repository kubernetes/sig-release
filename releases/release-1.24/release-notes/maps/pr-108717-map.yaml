releasenote:
  text: The metadata.clusterName field is deprecated. This field has always been unwritable
    and always blank, but its presence is confusing, so we will remove it next release.
    Out of an abundance of caution, this release we have merely changed the name in
    the go struct to ensure any accidental client uses are found before complete removal.
