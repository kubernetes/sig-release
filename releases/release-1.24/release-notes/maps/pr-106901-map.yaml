  text: Reverted graceful node shutdown to match 1.21 behavior of setting pods that
    have not yet successfully completed to "Failed" phase if the GracefulNodeShutdown
    feature is enabled in kubelet. The GracefulNodeShutdown feature is beta and must
    be explicitly configured via kubelet config to be enabled in 1.21+. This changes
    1.22 and 1.23 behavior on node shutdown to match 1.21. If you do not want pods
    to be marked terminated on node shutdown in 1.22 and 1.23, disable the GracefulNodeShutdown
    feature.
