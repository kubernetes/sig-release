    The kubelet now creates an iptables chain named `KUBE-IPTABLES-HINT` in
    the `mangle` table. Containerized components that need to modify iptables
    rules in the host network namespace can use the existence of this chain
    to more-reliably determine whether the system is using iptables-legacy or
    iptables-nft.
