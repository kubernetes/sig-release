  text: Added an e2e test to verify that the cluster is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-29923
    when using Services with IPs with leading zeros, note that this test is a necessary
    but not sufficient condition, all the components in the clusters that consume
    IPs addresses from the APIs MUST interpret them as decimal or discard them.
