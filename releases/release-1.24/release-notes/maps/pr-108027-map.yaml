  text: 'kubeadm: graduated the `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap` feature gate to Beta
    and enabled the feature by default. This implies that 1) for new clusters kubeadm
    will start using the `kube-system/kubelet-config` naming scheme for the kubelet
    ConfigMap and RBAC rules, instead of the legacy `kubelet-config-x.yy` naming.
    2) during upgrade, kubeadm will only write the new scheme ConfigMap and RBAC objects.
    To disable the feature you can pass `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap: false` in the
    kubeadm config for new clusters. For upgrade on existing clusters you can also
    override the behavior by patching the ClusterConfiguration object in `kube-system/kubeadm-config`.
    More details in the associated KEP.'
