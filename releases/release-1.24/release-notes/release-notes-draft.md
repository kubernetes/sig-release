## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Docker runtime support using dockershim in the kubelet is now completely removed in 1.24. The kubelet used to have a module called dockershim, which implements CRI support for Docker, and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. From 1.24 onwards, please move to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#97252](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97252), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
 - Fixed bug with leads to Node goes `Not-ready` state when credentials for vCenter stored in a secret and Zones feature is in use. Zone labels setup moved to KCM component, kubelet skips this step during startup in such case. If credentials stored in cloud-provider config file as plaintext current behaviour does not change and no action required. For proper functioning `kube-system:vsphere-legacy-cloud-provider` should be allowed to update node object if vCenter credentials stored in secret and Zone feature used. ([#101028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101028), [@lobziik](https://github.com/lobziik))
 - The `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is beta, and enabled by default. When enabled, Secret API objects containing service account tokens are no longer auto-generated for every ServiceAccount. Use the [TokenRequest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-request-v1/) API to acquire service account tokens, or if a non-expiring token is required, create a Secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following this [guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#service-account-token-secrets). ([#108309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108309), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Testing]
 - The calculations for Pod topology spread skew now exclude nodes that
  don't match the node affinity/selector. This may lead to unschedulable pods if you previously had pods
  matching the spreading selector on those excluded nodes (not matching the node affinity/selector),
  especially when the `topologyKey` is not node-level. Revisit the node affinity and/or pod selector in the
  topology spread constraints to avoid this scenario. ([#107009](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107009), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- --pod-infra-container-image kubelet flag is deprecated and will be removed in future releases ([#108045](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108045), [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman)) [SIG Node]
- Client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1 ExecCredential has been removed. If you are using a client-go credential plugin that relies on the v1alpha1 API please contact the distributor of your plugin for instructions on how to migrate to the v1 API. ([#108616](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108616), [@margocrawf](https://github.com/margocrawf)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Cluster addon for dashboard was removed. To install dashboard, see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/README.md). ([#107481](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107481), [@shu-mutou](https://github.com/shu-mutou))
- Deprecated `Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`. This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.  As of Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.  This field may be removed in a future API version. ([#107235](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek))
- Kube-apiserver: the `--master-count` flag and `--endpoint-reconciler-type=master-count` reconciler are deprecated in favor of the lease reconciler ([#108062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108062), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Kube-apiserver: the insecure address flags `--address`, `--insecure-bind-address`, `--port` and `--insecure-port` (inert since 1.20) are removed ([#106859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106859), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- Kubeadm: graduated the `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap` feature gate to Beta and enabled the feature by default. This implies that 1) for new clusters kubeadm will start using the `kube-system/kubelet-config` naming scheme for the kubelet ConfigMap and RBAC rules, instead of the legacy `kubelet-config-x.yy` naming. 2) during upgrade, kubeadm will only write the new scheme ConfigMap and RBAC objects. To disable the feature you can pass `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap: false` in the kubeadm config for new clusters. For upgrade on existing clusters you can also override the behavior by patching the ClusterConfiguration object in `kube-system/kubeadm-config`. More details in the associated KEP. ([#108027](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108027), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Remove `tolerate-unready-endpoints` annotation in Service deprecated from 1.11, use `Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses` instead. ([#108020](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108020), [@tossmilestone](https://github.com/tossmilestone))
- Remove deprecated feature gates ValidateProxyRedirects and StreamingProxyRedirects ([#106830](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106830), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The experimental dynamic log sanitization feature has been deprecated and removed in the 1.24 release. The feature is no longer available for use. ([#107207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107207), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman))
- The in-tree azure plugin has been deprecated.  The https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin serves as an out-of-tree replacement via the kubectl/client-go credential plugin mechanism.  Users will now see a warning in the logs regarding this deprecation. ([#107904](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107904), [@sabbey37](https://github.com/sabbey37))
- The insecure address flags `--address` and `--port` in kube-controller-manager have had no effect since v1.20 and are removed in v1.24. ([#106860](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106860), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- The node.k8s.io/v1alpha1 RuntimeClass API is no longer served. Use the node.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since v1.20 ([#103061](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103061), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI, Node and Testing]
- `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release, possibly in 3 releases (one year). You should start using `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3` for new clusters. To migrate your old configuration files on disk you can use the `kubeadm config migrate` command. ([#107013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107013), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))

### API Change

- Add 2 new options for kube-proxy running in winkernel mode. 
  `--forward-healthcheck-vip`, if specified as true, health check traffic whose destination is service VIP will be forwarded to kube-proxy's healthcheck service. `--root-hnsendpoint-name` specifies the name of the hns endpoint for the root network namespace.
  This option enables the pass-through load balancers like Google's GCLB to correctly health check the backend services. Without this change, the health check packets is dropped, and Windows node will be considered to be unhealthy by those load balancers. ([#99287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99287), [@anfernee](https://github.com/anfernee)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Network, Testing and Windows]
- Added CEL runtime cost calculation into CustomerResource validation. CustomerResource validation will fail if runtime cost exceeds the budget. ([#108482](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108482), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added a new metric `webhook_fail_open_count` to monitor webhooks that fail to open. ([#107171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107171), [@ltagliamonte-dd](https://github.com/ltagliamonte-dd))
- CRD deep copies should no longer contain shallow copies of `JSONSchemaProps.XValidations`. ([#107956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107956), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- CRD writes will generate validation errors if a CEL validation rule references the identifier "oldSelf" on a part of the schema that does not support it. ([#108013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108013), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery]

- Fixed failed flushing logs in defer function when kubelet cmd exit 1. ([#104774](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104774), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
- Fixes a regression in v1beta1 PodDisruptionBudget handling of "strategic merge patch"-type API requests for the `selector` field. Prior to 1.21, these requests would merge `matchLabels` content and replace `matchExpressions` content. In 1.21, patch requests touching the `selector` field started replacing the entire selector. This is consistent with server-side apply and the v1 PodDisruptionBudget behavior, but should not have been changed for v1beta1. ([#108138](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108138), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Apps, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: --audit-log-version and --audit-webhook-version now only support the default value of audit.k8s.io/v1. The v1alpha1 and v1beta1 audit log versions, deprecated since 1.13, have been removed. ([#108092](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108092), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

([#106366](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106366), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder))
- Suspend job to GA. The feature gate SuspendJob is locked and will be removed in 1.26. ([#108129](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108129), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g)) [SIG Apps and Testing]
- The CertificateSigningRequest `spec.expirationSeconds` API field has graduated to GA. The `CSRDuration` feature gate for the field is now unconditionally enabled and will be removed in 1.26. ([#108782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108782), [@cfryanr](https://github.com/cfryanr)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Instrumentation and Testing]
- The `ServiceLBNodePortControl` feature has graduated to GA. The feature gate will be removed in 1.26. ([#107027](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107027), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek))
- The feature `DynamicKubeletConfig` has been removed from the kubelet. ([#106932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106932), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- TopologySpreadConstraints includes minDomains field to limit the minimum number of topology domains. ([#107674](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107674), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Scheduling]
- Updated the default API priority-and-fairness config to avoid endpoint/configmaps operations from controller-manager to all match leader-election priority level. ([#106725](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106725), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t))

### Feature

- Added a path `/header?key=` to `agnhost netexec` allowing one to view what the header value is of the incoming request.
  
  Ex:
  
  ```$ curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: something" 172.17.0.2:8080/header?key=X-Forwarded-For
  something``` ([#107796](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107796), [@alexanderConstantinescu](https://github.com/alexanderConstantinescu))

- CRD x-kubernetes-validations rules now support the CEL functions: isSorted, sum, min, max, indexOf, lastIndexOf, find and findAll. ([#108312](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108312), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Client-go metrics: change bucket distribution for rest_client_request_duration_seconds and rest_client_rate_limiter_duration_seconds from [0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, 0.032, 0.064, 0.128, 0.256, 0.512] to [0.005, 0.025, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 15.0, 30.0, 60.0}] ([#106911](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106911), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture and Instrumentation]
- Client-go: add new histogram metric to record the size of the requests and responses. ([#108296](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108296), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture and Instrumentation]
- Cluster/gce/gci/configure.sh now supports downloading crictl on ARM64 nodes ([#108034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108034), [@tstapler](https://github.com/tstapler)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Env var for additional cli flags used in the csi-proxy binary when a Windows nodepool is created with kube-up.sh ([#107806](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107806), [@mauriciopoppe](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Windows]
- Feature of `PreferNominatedNode` is graduated to GA. ([#106619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106619), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave))
- In text format, log messages that previously used quoting to prevent multi-line output (for example, text="some \"quotation\", a\nline break") will now be printed with more readable multi-line output without the escape sequences. ([#107103](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107103), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Increase default value of discovery cache TTL for kubectl to 6 hours. ([#107141](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107141), [@mk46](https://github.com/mk46)) [SIG CLI]
- Introduce policy to allow the HPA to consume the external.metrics.k8s.io API group. ([#104244](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104244), [@dgrisonnet](https://github.com/dgrisonnet)) [SIG Auth, Autoscaling and Instrumentation]
- Kube-apiserver: when merging lists, Server Side Apply now prefers the order of the submitted request instead of the existing persisted object. ([#107565](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107565), [@jiahuif](https://github.com/jiahuif))
- Kubeadm: added support for dry running `kubeadm reset`. The new flag `kubeadm reset --dry-run` is similar to the existing flag for `kubeadm init/join/upgrade` and allows you to see what changes would be applied. ([#107512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107512), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: apply "second stage" of the plan to migrate kubeadm away from the usage of the word "master" in labels and taints. For new clusters, the label "node-role.kubernetes.io/master" will no longer be added to control plane nodes, only the label "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane" will be added. For clusters that are being upgraded to 1.24 with "kubeadm upgrade apply", the command will remove the label "node-role.kubernetes.io/master" from existing control plane nodes. For new clusters, both the old taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule" and new taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule" will be added to control plane nodes. In release 1.20 ("first stage"), a release note instructed to preemptively tolerate the new taint. For clusters that are being upgraded to 1.24 with "kubeadm upgrade apply", the command will add the new taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule" to existing control plane nodes. Please adapt your infrastructure to these changes. In 1.25 the old taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule" will be removed. ([#107533](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107533), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: better surface errors during "kubeadm upgrade" when waiting for the kubelet to restart static pods on control plane nodes ([#108315](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108315), [@Monokaix](https://github.com/Monokaix)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: default the kubeadm configuration to the containerd socket (Unix: `unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock`, Windows: `npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd`) instead of the one for Docker. If the `Init|JoinConfiguration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` field is empty during cluster creation and multiple sockets are found on the host always throw an error and ask the user to specify which one to use by setting the value in the field. Make sure you update any kubeadm configuration files on disk, to not include the dockershim socket unless you are still using kubelet version < 1.24 with kubeadm >= 1.24.
  
  Remove the DockerValidor and ServiceCheck for the `docker` service from kubeadm preflight. Docker is no longer special cased during host validation and ideally this task should be done in the now external cri-dockerd project where the importance of the compatibility matters.
  
  Use `crictl` for all communication with CRI sockets for actions like pulling images and obtaining a list of running containers instead of using the docker CLI in the case of Docker. ([#107317](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107317), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: improve the strict parsing of user YAML/JSON configuration files. Next to printing warnings for unknown and duplicate fields (current state), also print warnings for fields with incorrect case sensitivity - e.g. "controlPlaneEndpoint" (valid), "ControlPlaneEndpoint" (invalid). Instead of only printing warnings during "init" and "join" also print warnings when downloading the ClusterConfiguration, KubeletConfiguration or KubeProxyConfiguration objects from the cluster. This can be useful if the user has patched these objects in their respective ConfigMaps with mistakes. ([#107725](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107725), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubelet: add kubelet_volume_metric_collection_duration_seconds metrics for volume disk usage calculation duration ([#107201](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107201), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Instrumentation, Node and Storage]
- Kubelet: the following dockershim related flags are also removed along with dockershim `--experimental-dockershim-root-directory`, `--docker-endpoint`, `--image-pull-progress-deadline`, `--network-plugin`, `--cni-conf-dir`, `--cni-bin-dir`, `--cni-cache-dir`, `--network-plugin-mtu`. ([#106907](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106907), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder))
- Kubernetes in now built with go1.18rc1 ([#107105](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107105), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Node, Release, Storage and Testing]

- OpenStack Cinder CSI migration is now GA and switched on by default, Cinder CSI driver must be installed on clusters on OpenStack for Cinder volumes to work (has been since v1.21). ([#107462](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107462), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- PreFilter extension in the scheduler framework now returns not only status but also PreFilterResult ([#108648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108648), [@ahg-g](https://github.com/ahg-g)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Remove the deprecated flag `--experimental-check-node-capabilities-before-mount`. With CSI now GA, there is a better alternative. Remove any use of  `--experimental-check-node-capabilities-before-mount` from your kubelet scripts or manifests. ([#104732](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104732), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu)) [SIG Apps, Cloud Provider, Node and Storage]

- Kube-apiserver: ensures the namespace of objects sent to admission webhooks matches the request namespace. Previously, objects without a namespace set would have the request namespace populated after mutating admission, and objects with a namespace that did not match the request namespace would be rejected after admission. ([#94637](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94637), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]

- Endpoints and EndpointSlice controllers no longer populate [resourceVersion of targetRef](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/object-reference/#ObjectReference) in Endpoints and EndpointSlices ([#108450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108450), [@tnqn](https://github.com/tnqn)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Fixed default config flags for `NewDefaultKubectlCommand`. ([#107131](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107131), [@jonnylangefeld](https://github.com/jonnylangefeld))
- Fixed documentation typo in cloud-provider. ([#106445](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106445), [@majst01](https://github.com/majst01))
- Fixed spelling of implemented in pkg/proxy/apis/config/types.go line 206 ([#106453](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106453), [@davidleitw](https://github.com/davidleitw))
- Improve error message when applying CRDs before the CRD exists in a cluster ([#107363](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107363), [@eddiezane](https://github.com/eddiezane)) [SIG CLI]
- Improved algorithm for selecting "best" non-preferred hint in the TopologyManager ([#108154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108154), [@klueska](https://github.com/klueska)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-proxy doesn't set the sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1 if no IPv4 loopback address is selected by the nodePortAddresses configuration parameter. ([#107684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107684), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network]
- Kubeadm: all warning messages are printed to stderr instead of stdout. ([#107467](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107467), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: handled the removal of dockershim related flags for new kubeadm clusters. If kubelet <1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 can continue using the built-in dockershim in the kubelet if the user passes the `{Init|Join}Configuration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` value in the kubeadm configuration to be equal to `unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock` on Unix or `npipe:////./pipe/dockershim` on Windows. If kubelet version >=1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will treat all container runtimes as "remote" using the kubelet flags `--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=scheme://some/path`. The special management for kubelet <1.24 will be removed in kubeadm 1.25. ([#106973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106973), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: make sure that `kubeadm init/join` always use a URL scheme (unix:// on Linux and npipe:// on Windows) when passing a value to the `--container-runtime-endpoint` kubelet flag. This flag's value is taken from the kubeadm configuration `criSocket` field or the `--cri-socket` CLI flag. Automatically add a missing URL scheme to the user configuration in memory, but warn them that they should also update their configuration on disk manually. During `kubeadm upgrade apply/node` mutate the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on disk and the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation Node object if needed. These automatic actions are temporary and will be removed in a future release. In the future the kubelet may not support CRI endpoints without an URL scheme.

- Kubeadm: remove the `IPv6DualStack` feature gate. The feature has been GA and locked to enabled since 1.23. ([#106648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106648), [@calvin0327](https://github.com/calvin0327))
- Kubeadm: removed the deprecated `output/v1alpha1` API used for machine readable output by some kubeadm commands. In 1.23 kubeadm started using the newer version `output/v1alpha2` for the same purpose. ([#107468](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107468), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: removed the restriction that the `ca.crt` can only contain one certificate. If there is more than one certificate in the `ca.crt` file, kubeadm will pick the first one by default. ([#107327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107327), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubectl stack traces now only print at verbose -v=99 and not -v=6 ([#108053](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108053), [@eddiezane](https://github.com/eddiezane))
- Kubectl: restored `--dry-run`, `--dry-run=true`, and `--dry-run=false` for compatibility with pre-1.23 invocations. ([#107003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107003), [@julianvmodesto](https://github.com/julianvmodesto))
- Kubelet config validation error messages are updated ([#105360](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105360), [@shuheiktgw](https://github.com/shuheiktgw))
- Kubernetes e2e framework will use the url `invalid.registry.k8s.io/invalid` instead `invalid.com/invalid` for test that use an invalid registry. ([#107455](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107455), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Marked kubelet `--container-runtime-endpoint` and `--image-service-endpoint` CLI flags as stable. ([#106954](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106954), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

- The `WarningHeaders` feature gate that is GA since v1.22 is unconditionally enabled, and can no longer be specified via the `--feature-gates` argument. ([#108394](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108394), [@ialidzhikov](https://github.com/ialidzhikov)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The e2e.test binary supports a new `--kubelet-root` parameter to override the default `/var/lib/kubelet` path. CSI storage tests use this. ([#108253](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108253), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node, Storage and Testing]
