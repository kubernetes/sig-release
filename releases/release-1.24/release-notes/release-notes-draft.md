## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Docker runtime support using dockershim in the kubelet is now completely removed in 1.24. The kubelet used to have a module called dockershim, which implements CRI support for Docker, and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. From 1.24 onwards, please move to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#97252](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97252), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
 - The calculations for Pod topology spread skew now excludes nodes that
  don't match the node affinity/selector. This may lead to unschedulable pods if you previously had pods
  matching the spreading selector on those excluded nodes (not matching the node affinity/selector),
  especially when the topologyKey is not node-level. Revisit the node affinity and/or pod selector in the
  topology spread constraints to avoid this scenario. ([#107009](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107009), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG Scheduling]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- "kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2" has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release, possibly in 3 releases (one year). You should start using "kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3" for new clusters. To migrate your old configuration files on disk you can use the "kubeadm config migrate" command. ([#107013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107013), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Deprecate Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP. This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.  As of Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.  This field may be removed in a future API version. ([#107235](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Kube-apiserver: the insecure address flags `--address`, `--insecure-bind-address`, `--port` and `--insecure-port` (inert since 1.20) are removed ([#106859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106859), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Cluster Lifecycle]
- The experimental dynamic log sanitization feature has been deprecated and removed in the 1.24 release. The feature is no longer available for use. ([#107207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107207), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman)) [SIG Instrumentation, Scheduling and Security]
- The insecure address flags `--address` and `--port` in kube-controller-manager have been no effect since v1.20 and is removed in v1.24. ([#106860](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106860), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery, Node and Testing]

### API Change

- Add a new metric `webhook_fail_open_count` to monitor webhooks that fail open ([#107171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107171), [@ltagliamonte-dd](https://github.com/ltagliamonte-dd)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- Fix failed flushing logs in defer function when kubelet cmd exit 1. ([#104774](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104774), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet)) [SIG Node and Scheduling]
- Rename metrics `evictions_number` to `evictions_total` and mark it as stable. The original `evictions_number` metrics name is marked as "Deprecated" and will be removed in kubernetes 1.23 ([#106366](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106366), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]

- The feature DynamicKubeletConfig is removed from the kubelet. ([#106932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106932), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG Apps, Auth, Instrumentation, Node and Testing]
- Update default API priority-and-fairness config to avoid endpoint/configmaps operations from controller-manager to all match leader-election priority level. ([#106725](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106725), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t)) [SIG API Machinery]

### Feature

- A new Priority and Fairness metric 'apiserver_flowcontrol_work_estimate_seats_samples' has been 
  added that tracks the estimated seats associated with a request ([#106628](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106628), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]

- Add more message for no PodSandbox container ([#107116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107116), [@yxxhero](https://github.com/yxxhero)) [SIG Node]
- Added field add_ambient_capabilities to the Capabilities message in the CRI-API. ([#104620](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104620), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG Node]
- Added label selector flag to all "kubectl rollout" commands ([#99758](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99758), [@aramperes](https://github.com/aramperes)) [SIG CLI]
- Added metric for measuring end-to-end volume mount timing. ([#107006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107006), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
- Added prune flag into diff command to simulate `apply --prune` ([#105164](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105164), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Adds SetTransform to SharedInformer to allow users to transform objects before they are stored. ([#107507](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107507), [@alexzielenski](https://github.com/alexzielenski)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Adds proxy-url flag into kubectl config set-cluster ([#105566](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105566), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu)) [SIG CLI]
- Adds support for kubectl commands (`kubectl exec` and `kubectl port-forward`) via a SOCKS5 proxy. ([#105632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105632), [@xens](https://github.com/xens)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation and Storage]
- Feature of `PreferNominatedNode` is graduated  to GA ([#106619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106619), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- In text format, log messages that previously used quoting to prevent multi-line output (for example, text="some \"quotation\", a\nline break") will now be printed with more readable multi-line output without the escape sequences. ([#107103](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107103), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation and Storage]
- Kube-apiserver: when merging lists, Server Side Apply now prefers the order of the submitted request instead of the existing persisted object ([#107565](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107565), [@jiahuif](https://github.com/jiahuif)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Storage and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler remove insecure flags. You can use --bind-address and --secure-port instead. ([#106865](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106865), [@jonyhy96](https://github.com/jonyhy96)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kubeadm: add support for dry running "kubeadm reset". The new flag "kubeadm reset --dry-run" is similar to the existing flag for "kubeadm init/join/upgrade" and allows you to see what changes would be applied. ([#107512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107512), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: default the kubeadm configuration to the containerd socket (Unix: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock, Windows: "npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd") instead of the one for Docker. If the "Init|JoinConfiguration.nodeRegistration.criSocket" field is empty during cluster creation and multiple sockets are found on the host always throw an error and ask the user to specify which one to use by setting the value in the field. Make sure you update any kubeadm configuration files on disk, to not include the dockershim socket unless you are still using kubelet version < 1.24 with kubeadm >= 1.24.
  
  Remove the DockerValidor and ServiceCheck for the "docker" service from kubeadm preflight. Docker is no longer special cased during host validation and ideally this task should be done in the now external cri-dockerd project where the importance of the compatibility matters.
  
  Use crictl for all communication with CRI sockets for actions like pulling images and obtaining a list of running containers instead of using the docker CLI in the case of Docker. ([#107317](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107317), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- Kubelet: following dockershim related flags are also removed along with dockershim 
  --experimental-dockershim-root-directory, --docker-endpoint, --image-pull-progress-deadline, --network-plugin, 
  --cni-conf-dir,--cni-bin-dir, --cni-cache-dir, --network-plugin-mtu ([#106907](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106907), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Node and Testing]

- Kubernetes is now built with Golang 1.17.6 ([#107612](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107612), [@palnabarun](https://github.com/palnabarun)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- OpenStack Cinder CSI migration is now GA and switched on by default, Cinder CSI driver must be installed on clusters on OpenStack for Cinder volumes to work (has been since v1.21). ([#107462](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107462), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Remove feature gate `ImmutableEphemeralVolumes`. ([#107152](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107152), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu)) [SIG Node and Storage]

- This adds a path `/header?key=` to `agnhost netexec` allowing one to view what the header value is of the incoming request.
  
  Ex:
  
  $ curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: something" 172.17.0.2:8080/header?key=X-Forwarded-For
  something ([#107796](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107796), [@alexanderConstantinescu](https://github.com/alexanderConstantinescu)) [SIG Testing]

- Kubeadm: all warning messages are printed to stderr instead of stdout. ([#107467](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107467), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: handle the removal of dockershim related flags for new kubeadm clusters. If kubelet <1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 can continue using the built-in dockershim in the kubelet if the user passes the "{Init|Join}Configuration.nodeRegistration.criSocket" value in the kubeadm configuration to be equal to "unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock" on Unix or "npipe:////./pipe/dockershim" on Windows. If kubelet version >=1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will treat all container runtimes as "remote" using the kubelet flags "--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=scheme://some/path". The special management for kubelet <1.24 will be removed in kubeadm 1.25. ([#106973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106973), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: make sure that "kubeadm init/join" always use a URL scheme (unix:// on Linux and npipe:// on Windows) when passing a value to the "--container-runtime-endpoint" kubelet flag. This flag's value is taken from the kubeadm configuration "criSocket" field or the "--cri-socket" CLI flag. Automatically add a missing URL scheme to the user configuration in memory, but warn them that they should also update their configuration on disk manually. During "kubeadm upgrade apply/node" mutate the "/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env" file on disk and the "kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket" annotation Node object if needed. These automatic actions are temporary and will be removed in a future release. In the future the kubelet may not support CRI endpoints without an URL scheme.

- Kubeadm: remove the IPv6DualStack feature gate. The feature has been GA and locked to enabled since 1.23. ([#106648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106648), [@calvin0327](https://github.com/calvin0327)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated output/v1alpha1 API used for machine readable output by some kubeadm commands. In 1.23 kubeadm started using the newer version output/v1alpha2 for the same purpose. ([#107468](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107468), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: remove the restriction that the ca.crt can only contain one certificate. If there is more than one certificate in the ca.crt file, kubeadm will pick the first one by default.
