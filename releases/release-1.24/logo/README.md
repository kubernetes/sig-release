# Stargazer Release Logo

Two versions of the logo are provided: the main logo and a small logo. The small logo is intended for use at 128Ã—128 pixels, such as a Slack react. All other uses should use the main logo.

Both are provided in PNG and SVG format. The original Affinity Designer file is also provided, but should be avoided for display purposes.

The Logo was created by [Britnee Laverack](https://www.instagram.com/artsyfie/) for the Kubernetes project.
