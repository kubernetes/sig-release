Hello ___SIG Name___!

We are starting to collect release notes for the major changes in Kubernetes 1.8.
A [draft](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.8/release-notes-draft.md) [1]
has been prepared in the 1.8 release directory but we need your help to populate the changes by
component which is how we have organized [previous release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.7/release-notes-draft.md) [2].
We would like to have the draft release notes finished by 08 September 2017 which is one week after code freeze.
Once your SIG has filled out their section according to the [guidance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/484) [3],
provided by Brian Grant, please check off your section in the checklist
[embedded in the draft](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.8/release-notes-draft.md#checklist-for-sigs-and-release-team) [4].
Feel free to submit a pull request against the `master` branch or to merge your changes directly into master once
there is agreement within the SIG. Please bring any questions to SIG Release on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-release) [5]
or on [slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C56HWQ0TH/) [6].

Thanks!
