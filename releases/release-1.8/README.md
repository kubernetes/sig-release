# Proposed timeline for 1.8
We will begin the 1.8 release the first week of July 2017.

The proposal below is similar in layout to the 1.7 plans with some
modifications:
- as before, key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- new in 1.8
  * alpha's should not be cut unless all master-release-blocking tests are passing
  * release notes for planned features done 2 weeks out from feature freeze
  * docs PRs deadlines ahead of release

  * Release team to create release notes draft doc and share broadly
- Sept 6th (Weds): v1.8.0-beta.0
  * Branch Manager to create `release-1.8` branch.
  * v1.9.0-alpha.0 is cut
  * Test-infra lead to set up CI for branch.

- Sept 13th (Weds): End of Code Freeze
  * v1.8.0-beta.1 cut
  * Final fast-forward of release branch.

  * Announce on mailing lists, Twitter, etc. to ask people to build and test the RC and submit feedback
  * Perhaps managed k8s providers make rc.1 available on early access channels.
  * More RCs as needed to verify release-blocking fixes.
- Release 1.8 on Sept 27 (Wednesday)

## Operational Changes 
1. For the 1.8 release, the [release team](release_team.md)
  will use the following procedure to identify release blocking issues
  1. Any issues listed in the [v1.8 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.8)
     will be considered release blocking. It is everyone's responsibility to move non blocking issues out of the `v1.8` milestone. Items targeting 1.8 can be moved into the `v1.8` milestone.
     milestones **or the release will not ship**
