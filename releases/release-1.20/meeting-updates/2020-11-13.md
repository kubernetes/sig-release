## Release Branch Management

Author: Marko Mudrinić / xmudrii
Current Status: Green

Updates:
  - Code Freeze has started yesterday (November 12th)
  - Upcoming milestones:
      - **beta.2**: Tuesday, November 17th (next week)
          - this is the last beta release for this cycle
      - **Test Freeze:** Monday, November 23th (week after KubeCon)
      - **release-1.20 branch cut and jobs created**: Tuesday, December 1st
      - **rc.0**: Tuesday, December 1st
      - **v1.20.0**: Tuesday, December 8th
  - Branch fast-forward and cherry-picks:
      - After discussion with Release Managers and Release Leads, it has been decided that we will **not** do fast-forwards this release cycle
      - Once the release branch is cut, PRs targeting this release have to be cherry-picked to the release branch
      - Historically, we have been cutting the release branch much earlier in the release cycle, so we were doing fast-forwards to keep the master branch and the release branch in sync. This release cycle the branch cut is a week before the release
      - Since there is only one week between the branch cut and the release, requiring cherry-picks allows us to have better control over what gets merged for the release
