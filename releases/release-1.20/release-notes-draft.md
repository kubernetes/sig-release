# Changelog since v1.19.0

## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kubeadm: improve the validation of serviceSubnet and podSubnet.
  ServiceSubnet has to be limited in size, due to implementation details, and the mask can not allocate more than 20 bits.
  PodSubnet validates against the corresponding cluster "--node-cidr-mask-size" of the kube-controller-manager, it fail if the values are not compatible.
  kubeadm no longer sets the node-mask automatically on IPv6 deployments, you must check that your IPv6 service subnet mask is compatible with the default node mask /64 or set it accordenly. 
  Previously, for IPv6, if the podSubnet had a mask lower than /112, kubeadm calculated a node-mask to be multiple of eight and splitting the available bits to maximise the number used for nodes. ([#95723](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95723), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
 - The deprecated flag --experimental-kustomize is now removed from kubeadm commands. Use --experimental-patches instead, which was introduced in 1.19. Migration infromation available in --help description for --exprimental-patches. ([#94871](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94871), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
 - Windows hyper-v container featuregate is deprecated in 1.20 and will be removed in 1.21 ([#95505](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95505), [@wawa0210](https://github.com/wawa0210)) [SIG Node and Windows]

([#94938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94938), [@yagonobre](https://github.com/yagonobre)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated "kubeadm alpha kubelet config enable-dynamic" command. To continue using the feature please defer to the guide for "Dynamic Kubelet Configuration" at k8s.io. This change also removes the parent command "kubeadm alpha kubelet" as there are no more sub-commands under it for the time being. ([#94668](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94668), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

### API Change

- + `TokenRequest` and `TokenRequestProjection` features have been promoted to GA. This feature allows generating service account tokens that are not visible in Secret objects and are tied to the lifetime of a Pod object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/&#35;service-account-token-volume-projection for details on configuring and using this feature. The `TokenRequest` and `TokenRequestProjection` feature gates will be removed in v1.21.
  + kubeadm's kube-apiserver Pod manifest now includes the following flags by default "--service-account-key-file", "--service-account-signing-key-file", "--service-account-issuer". ([#93258](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93258), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle, Storage and Testing]
- A new `nofuzz` go build tag now disables gofuzz support. Release binaries enable this. ([#92491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92491), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Add dual-stack Services (alpha).  This is a BREAKING CHANGE to an alpha API.
  It changes the dual-stack API wrt Service from a single ipFamily field to 3
  fields: ipFamilyPolicy (SingleStack, PreferDualStack, RequireDualStack),
  ipFamilies (a list of families assigned), and clusterIPs (inclusive of
  clusterIP).  Most users do not need to set anything at all, defaulting will
  handle it for them.  Services are single-stack unless the user asks for
  dual-stack.  This is all gated by the "IPv6DualStack" feature gate. ([#91824](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91824), [@khenidak](https://github.com/khenidak)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Network, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Certain fields on  Service objects will be automatically cleared when changing the service's `type` to a mode that does not need those fields.  For example, changing from type=LoadBalancer to type=ClusterIP will clear the NodePort assignments, rather than forcing the user to clear them. ([#95196](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95196), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network and Testing]
- External facing API podresources is now available under k8s.io/kubelet/pkg/apis/ ([#92632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92632), [@RenaudWasTaken](https://github.com/RenaudWasTaken)) [SIG Node and Testing]

- Server Side Apply now treats LabelSelector fields as atomic (meaning the entire selector is managed by a single writer and updated together), since they contain interrelated and inseparable fields that do not merge in intuitive ways. ([#93901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93901), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Services will now have a `clusterIPs` field to go with `clusterIP`.  `clusterIPs[0]` is a synonym for `clusterIP` and will be syncronized on create and update operations. ([#95894](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95894), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG Network]
- The ServiceAccountIssuerDiscovery feature gate is now Beta and enabled by default. ([#91921](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91921), [@mtaufen](https://github.com/mtaufen)) [SIG Auth]

- Introduces a new GCE specific cluster creation variable KUBE_PROXY_DISABLE. When set to true, this will skip over the creation of kube-proxy (whether the daemonset or static pod). This can be used to control the lifecycle of kube-proxy separately from the lifecycle of the nodes. ([#91977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91977), [@varunmar](https://github.com/varunmar)) [SIG Cloud Provider]
- Kube-apiserver: The timeout used when making health check calls to etcd can now be configured with `--etcd-healthcheck-timeout`. The default timeout is 2 seconds, matching the previous behavior.

- Kubernetes is now built using go1.15.2
  - build: Update to k/repo-infra@v0.1.1 (supports go1.15.2)
  - build: Use go-runner:buster-v2.0.1 (built using go1.15.1)
  - bazel: Replace --features with Starlark build settings flag
  - hack/lib/util.sh: some bash cleanups
    
    - switched one spot to use kube::logging
    - make kube::util::find-binary return an error when it doesn't find
      anything so that hack scripts fail fast instead of with '' binary not
      found errors.
    - this required deleting some genfeddoc stuff. the binary no longer
      exists in k/k repo since we removed federation/, and I don't see it
      in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/ either. I'm assuming
      that it's gone for good now.
  
  - bazel: output go_binary rule directly from go_binary_conditional_pure
    
    From: @mikedanese:
    Instead of aliasing. Aliases are annoying in a number of ways. This is
    specifically bugging me now because they make the action graph harder to
    analyze programmatically. By using aliases here, we would need to handle
    potentially aliased go_binary targets and dereference to the effective
    target.
  
    The comment references an issue with `pure = select(...)` which appears
    to be resolved considering this now builds.
  
  - make kube::util::find-binary not dependent on bazel-out/ structure
  
    Implement an aspect that outputs go_build_mode metadata for go binaries,
    and use that during binary selection. ([#94449](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94449), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus)) [SIG Architecture, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Node, Release and Testing]

- SCTP support in API objects (Pod, Service, NetworkPolicy) is now GA.
  Note that this has no effect on whether SCTP is enabled on nodes at the kernel level,
  and note that some cloud platforms and network plugins do not support SCTP traffic. ([#95566](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95566), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Apps and Network]

- Support for Windows container images (OS Versions: 1809, 1903, 1909, 2004) was added the pause:3.4 image. ([#91452](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91452), [@claudiubelu](https://github.com/claudiubelu)) [SIG Node, Release and Windows]
- Warns user when executing kubectl apply/diff to resource currently being deleted. ([#95544](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95544), [@SaiHarshaK](https://github.com/SaiHarshaK)) [SIG CLI]
- `kubectl debug` gains support for changing container images when copying a pod for debugging, similar to how `kubectl set image` works. See `kubectl help debug` for more information. ([#96058](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96058), [@verb](https://github.com/verb)) [SIG CLI]

- Build/lib/release: Explicitly use '--platform' in building server images
  
  When we switched to go-runner for building the apiserver,
  controller-manager, and scheduler server components, we no longer
  reference the individual architectures in the image names, specifically
  in the 'FROM' directive of the server image Dockerfiles.
  
  As a result, server images for non-amd64 images copy in the go-runner
  amd64 binary instead of the go-runner that matches that architecture.
  
  This commit explicitly sets the '--platform=linux/${arch}' to ensure
  we're pulling the correct go-runner arch from the manifest list.
  
  Before:
  `FROM ${base_image}`
  
  After:
  `FROM --platform=linux/${arch} ${base_image}` ([#94552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94552), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus)) [SIG Release]
