    Removed all support for _classic_ dynamic resource allocation (DRA). The `DRAControlPlaneController` feature gate, formerly alpha, is no longer available. Kubernetes now only uses the _structured parameters_ model (also alpha) for allocating dynamic resources to Pods.

    if and only if classic DRA was enabled in a cluster, remove all workloads (pods, app deployments, etc. ) which depend on classic DRA and make sure that all PodSchedulingContext resources are gone before upgrading. PodSchedulingContext resources cannot be removed through the apiserver after an upgrade and workloads would not work properly.
