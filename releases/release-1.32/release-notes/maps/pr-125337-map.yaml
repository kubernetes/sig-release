releasenote:
  text: The kubelet, when using `--cloud-provider=external` can use the `--node-ip` flag
    with one of the unspecified addresses 0.0.0.0 or ::, to create the Node with the
    IP of the default gateway of the corresponding IP family and then delegating the
    responsibility to the external cloud provider. This solve the bootstrap problems
    of out of tree cloud providers that are deployed as Pods within the cluster.
