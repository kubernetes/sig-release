  text: "1. When the kubelet constructs the CRI mounts for the container which references
    an `image` volume source type, it passes the missing mount attributes to the CRI
    implementation, including `readOnly`, `propagation`, and `recursiveReadOnly`.
    When the readOnly field of the containerMount is explicitly set to false, the
    kubelet will now take the `readOnly`as true to the CRI implementation because
    the image volume plugin requires the mount to be read-only. \n2. Fixed a bug where
    the pod is unexpectedly running when the `image` volume source type is used and
    mounted to `/etc/hosts` in the container."
