  text: 'Kube-scheduler removed `AzureDiskLimits` ,`CinderLimits` 
    `EBSLimits` and `GCEPDLimits` plugin. Given the corresponding CSI driver reports how many
    volumes a node can handle in NodeGetInfoResponse, the kubelet stores this limit
    in CSINode and the scheduler then knows the limit of the driver on the node. Removed
    plugins AzureDiskLimits, CinderLimits, EBSLimits and GCEPDLimits if you explicitly
    enabled them in the scheduler config.'
