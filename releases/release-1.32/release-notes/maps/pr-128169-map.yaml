    - Promotes the `ServiceAccountTokenPodNodeInfo` feature to GA, which adds the node name and uid as claims into service account tokens mounted into running pods, and embeds that information as `authentication.kubernetes.io/node-name` and `authentication.kubernetes.io/node-uid` user extra info when the token is used
    - Promotes the `ServiceAccountTokenNodeBindingValidation` feature to GA, which validates service account tokens bound directly to nodes.
