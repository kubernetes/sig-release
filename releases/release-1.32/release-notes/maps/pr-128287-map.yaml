  text: Ensured resizing for Guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests on nodes with
    static CPU & Memory policy configured is not allowed for the beta release of in-place
    resize. The feature gate `InPlacePodVerticalScalingExclusiveCPUs` defaults to
    `false`, but can be enabled to unblock development on ([#127262](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127262),
    [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG Node].
