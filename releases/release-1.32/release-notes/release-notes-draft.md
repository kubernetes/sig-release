## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- ACTION REQUIRED for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  `PodEligibleToPreemptOthers` in the `preemption` interface gets `ctx` in the parameters.
  Please change your plugins' implementation accordingly. ([#126465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126465), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Scheduling]
 - Changed NodeToStatusMap from map to struct and exposed methods to access the entries. Added absentNodesStatus, which inform what is the status of nodes that are absent in the map. 
  
  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, make sure to update usage of NodeToStatusMap. Additionally, NodeToStatusMap should be eventually renamed to NodeToStatusReader. ([#126022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126022), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Testing]
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Reverted the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to default-off to give a full year from deprecation announcement in 1.29 to clearing the field by default, per the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/). ([#126720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126720), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Architecture and Node]

### API Change

- Added enforcement of an upper cost bound for DRA evaluations of CEL. The API server and scheduler now enforce an upper bound on the cost and runtime steps required for evaluating a CEL expression. ([#128101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128101), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Allow for Pod search domains to be a single dot "." or contain an underscore "_" ([#127167](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127167), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Apps, Network and Testing]
- Annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/cronjob-scheduled-timestamp` added to Job objects scheduled from CronJobs is promoted to stable ([#128336](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128336), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG Apps]
- Apply fsGroup policy for ReadWriteOncePod volumes ([#128244](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128244), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied)) [SIG Storage and Testing]
- Disallow `k8s.io` and `kubernetes.io` namespaced extra key in structured authentication configuration. ([#126553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126553), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixed the bug where `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` of the pod will always be overwritten by the MaxPodGracePeriodSeconds of the soft eviction, you can enable the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate, which will restore the previous behavior.  If you do need to set this, please file an issue with the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand why you need it. ([#122890](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122890), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Fixed a bug in the NestedNumberAsFloat64 Unstructured field accessor that could cause it to return rounded float64 values instead of errors when accessing very large int64 values. ([#128099](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128099), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Graduate Job's ManagedBy field to Beta ([#127402](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127402), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Introduce compressible resource setting on system reserved and kube reserved slices ([#125982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125982), [@harche](https://github.com/harche)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the `StructuredAuthorizationConfiguration` feature gate to GA. The `--authorization-config` flag now accepts `AuthorizationConfiguration` in version `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1` (with no changes from `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1`). ([#128172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128172), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler removed the following plugins: 
  - AzureDiskLimits 
  - CinderLimits
  - EBSLimits
  - GCEPDLimits
  Because the corresponding CSI driver reports how many volumes a node can handle in NodeGetInfoResponse, the kubelet stores this limit in CSINode and the scheduler then knows the driver's limit on the node.
  Remove plugins AzureDiskLimits, CinderLimits, EBSLimits and GCEPDLimits if you explicitly enabled them in the scheduler config. ([#124003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124003), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kubelet: the `--image-credential-provider-config` file is now loaded with strict deserialization, which fails if the config file contains duplicate or unknown fields. This protects against accidentally running with config files that are malformed, mis-indented, or have typos in field names, and getting unexpected behavior. ([#128062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128062), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- Promoted `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` to stable; the feature is enabled by default. `--feature-gates=CustomResourceFieldSelectors=true` not needed on kube-apiserver binaries and will be removed in a future release. ([#127673](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127673), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Removed all support for _classic_ dynamic resource allocation (DRA). The `DRAControlPlaneController` feature gate, formerly alpha, is no longer available. Kubernetes now only uses the _structured parameters_ model (also alpha) for allocating dynamic resources to Pods.
  
  if and only if classic DRA was enabled in a cluster, remove all workloads (pods, app deployments, etc. ) which depend on classic DRA and make sure that all PodSchedulingContext resources are gone before upgrading. PodSchedulingContext resources cannot be removed through the apiserver after an upgrade and workloads would not work properly. ([#128003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128003), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Revised the Kubelet API Authorization with new subresources, that allow finer-grained authorization checks and access control for kubelet endpoints.
  Provided you enable the `KubeletFineGrainedAuthz` feature gate, you can access kubelet's `/healthz` endpoint by granting the caller `nodes/helathz` permission in RBAC.
  Similarly you can also access  kubelet's `/pods` endpoint to fetch a list of Pods bound to that node by granting the caller `nodes/pods` permission in RBAC.
  Similarly you can also access kubelet's `/configz` endpoint to fetch kubelet's configuration by granting the caller `nodes/configz` permission in RBAC.
  You can still access kubelet's `/healthz`, `/pods` and `/configz` by granting the caller `nodes/proxy` permission in RBAC but that also grants the caller permissions to exec, run and attach to containers on the nodes and doing so does not follow the least privilege principle. Granting callers more permissions than they need can give attackers an opportunity to escalate privileges. ([#126347](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126347), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- The default value for node-monitor-grace-period has been increased to 50s (earlier 40s) (Ref - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121793) ([#126287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126287), [@devppratik](https://github.com/devppratik)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The resource/v1alpha3.ResourceSliceList filed which should have been named "metadata" but was instead named "listMeta" is now properly "metadata". ([#126749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126749), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The synthetic "Bookmark" event for the watch stream requests will now include a new annotation: `kubernetes.io/initial-events-list-blueprint`. THe annotation contains an empty, versioned list that is encoded in the requested format (such as protobuf, JSON, or CBOR), then base64-encoded and stored as a string. ([#127587](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127587), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions.
  Name format CEL library is supported in new expressions. ([#126977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126977), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Updated incorrect description of persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy ([#126545](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126545), [@yangjunmyfm192085](https://github.com/yangjunmyfm192085)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and CLI]
- X.509 client certificate authentication to kube-apiserver now produces credential IDs (derived from the certificate's signature) for use by audit logging. ([#125634](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125634), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

### Feature

- Added an option to enable leader election in local-up-cluster.sh via the LEADER_ELECT cli flag. ([#127786](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127786), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added a kubelet metric `container_aligned_compute_resources_count`  to report the count of containers getting aligned compute resources ([#127155](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127155), [@ffromani](https://github.com/ffromani)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Added kubelet support for systemd watchdog integration. With this enabled, systemd can automatically recover a hung kubelet. ([#127566](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566), [@zhifei92](https://github.com/zhifei92)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Node and Testing]
- Added new functionality into the Go client code (`client-go`) library. The `List()` method for the metadata client allows enabling API streaming when fetching collections; this improves performance when listing many objects.
  To request this behaviour, your client software must enable the `WatchListClient` client-go feature gate. Additionally, streaming is only available if supported by the cluster; the API server that you connect to must also support streaming.
  If the API server does not support or allow streaming, then `client-go` falls back to fetching the collection using the **list** API verb. ([#127388](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127388), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Added preemptionPolicy field when using `kubectl get PriorityClass -owide` ([#126529](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126529), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG CLI]

- Allow pods to use the `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` and `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem` sysctl by default
  when the kernel version is 4.15 or higher. With the kernel 4.15 the sysctl became namespaced.
  Pod Security admission allows these sysctl in v1.32+ versions of the baseline and restricted policies. ([#127489](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127489), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Auth, Network and Node]

- DRA: the resource claim controller now maintains metrics about the total number of ResourceClaims and the number of allocated ResourceClaims. ([#127661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127661), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Apps, Instrumentation and Node]
- Enabled kube-controller-manager '--concurrent-job-syncs' flag works on orphan Pod processors ([#126567](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126567), [@fusida](https://github.com/fusida)) [SIG Apps]
- Extend discovery GroupManager with Group lister interface ([#127524](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127524), [@mjudeikis](https://github.com/mjudeikis)) [SIG API Machinery]

- Improve Node QueueHint in the NodeResource Fit plugin by ignoring unrelated changes that keep pods unschedulable. ([#127473](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127473), [@dom4ha](https://github.com/dom4ha)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Improve performance of the job controller when handling job delete events. ([#127378](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127378), [@hakuna-matatah](https://github.com/hakuna-matatah)) [SIG Apps]
- Improve performance of the job controller when handling job update events. ([#127228](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127228), [@hakuna-matatah](https://github.com/hakuna-matatah)) [SIG Apps]
- JWT authenticators now set the `jti` claim (if present and is a string value) as credential id for use by audit logging. ([#127010](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127010), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted `AuthorizeWithSelectors` feature to beta, which includes field and label selector information from requests in webhook authorization calls. Promoted `AuthorizeNodeWithSelectors` feature to beta, which changes node authorizer behavior to limit requests from node API clients, so that each Node can only get / list / watch its own Node API object, and can also only get / list / watch Pod API objects bound to that node. Clients using kubelet credentials to read other nodes or unrelated pods must change their authentication credentials (recommended), adjust their usage, or obtain broader read access independent of the node authorizer. ([#128168](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128168), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: a new `--requestheader-uid-headers` flag allows configuring request header authentication to obtain the authenticating user's UID from the specified headers. The suggested value for the new option is `X-Remote-Uid`. When specified, the `kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication` configmap will include the value in its `.data[requestheader-uid-headers]` field. ([#115834](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115834), [@stlaz](https://github.com/stlaz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Testing]
- Kube-proxy uses  field-selector clusterIP!=None on Services to avoid watching for Headless Services, reduce  unnecessary network bandwidth ([#126769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126769), [@Sakuralbj](https://github.com/Sakuralbj)) [SIG Network]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade apply` now supports phase sub-command, user can use `kubeadm upgrade apply phase <phase-name>` to execute the specified phase, or use `kubeadm upgrade apply --skip-phases <phase-names>` to skip some phases during cluster upgrade. ([#126032](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126032), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: `kubeadm upgrade node` now supports `addon` and `post-upgrade` phases. User can use `kubeadm upgrade node phase addon` to execute the addon upgrade, or use `kubeadm upgrade node --skip-phases addon` to skip the addon upgrade. Currently, the `post-upgrade` phase is no-op, and it is mainly used to handle some release specific post-upgrade tasks. ([#127242](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127242), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- Kubeadm: if an unknown command name is passed to any parent command such as 'kubeadm init phase' return an error. If 'kubeadm init phase' or another command that has subcommands is called without subcommand name, print the available commands and also return an error. ([#127096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127096), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: promoted feature gate `EtcdLearnerMode` to GA. Learner mode in etcd deployed by kubeadm is now locked to enabled by default. ([#126374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126374), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

  - Promotes the ServiceAccountTokenNodeBindingValidation feature to GA, which validates service account tokens bound directly to nodes. ([#128169](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128169), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Removed attachable volume limits from the capacity of the node for the following volume type when the kubelet is started, affecting the following volume types when the corresponding csi driver is installed:
  - `awsElasticBlockStore` for `ebs.csi.aws.com`
  - `azureDisk` for `disk.csi.azure.com`
  - `gcePersistentDisk` for `pd.csi.storage.googleapis.com`

- The scheduler retries gated Pods more appropriately, giving them a backoff penalty too. ([#126029](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126029), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]
- TopologyManagerPolicyOptions feature-flag is promoted to GA ([#128124](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128124), [@PiotrProkop](https://github.com/PiotrProkop)) [SIG Node]
- Transformation_operations_total metric will have additional resource label which can be used for resource specific validations for example handling of encryption config by the apiserver. ([#126512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126512), [@kmala](https://github.com/kmala)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Etcd and Testing]
- Unallowed label values will show up as "unexpected" in scheduler metrics ([#126762](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126762), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Vendor: updated system-validators to v1.9.0 ([#128149](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128149), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- When SchedulerQueueingHint is enabled,
  the scheduler's in-tree plugins now subscribe to specific node events to decide whether to requeue Pods.
  This allows the scheduler to handle cluster events faster with less memory.
  
  Specific node events include updates to taints, tolerations or allocatable.
  In-tree plugins now ignore node updates that don't modify any of these fields. ([#127220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127220), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Node, Scheduling and Storage]
- When SchedulerQueueingHints is enabled, clear events cached in the scheduling queue as soon as possible so that the scheduler consumes less memory. ([#120586](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120586), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling]

### Documentation

- Clarified the kube-controller-manager documentation for --allocate-node-cidrs, --cluster-cidr, and --service-cluster-ip-range flags to accurately reflect their dependencies and usage conditions.

- The kubelet, when using --cloud-provider=external can use the --node-ip flag with one of the unspecified addresses 0.0.0.0 or ::, to create the Node with the IP of the default gateway of the corresponding IP family and then delegating the responsibility to the external cloud provider. This solve the bootstrap problems of out of tree cloud providers that are deployed as Pods within the cluster.

- Fixed a bug which the scheduler didn't correctly tell plugins Node deletion.
  This bug could impact all scheduler plugins subscribing to Node/Delete event, making the queue keep the Pods rejected by those plugins incorrectly at Node deletion.

- Fixes a bug in the garbage collector controller which could block indefinitely on a cache sync failure. This fix allows the garbage collector to eventually continue garbage collecting other resources if a given resource cannot be listed or watched. Any objects in the unsynced resource type with owner references with `blockOwnerDeletion: true` will not be known to the garbage collector. Use of `blockOwnerDeletion` has always been best-effort and racy on startup and object creation, with this fix, it continues to be best-effort for resources that cannot be synced by the garbage collector controller.
