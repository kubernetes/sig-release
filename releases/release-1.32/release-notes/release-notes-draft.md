## Urgent Upgrade Notes

There are no urgent upgrade notes for the v1.32 release.

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Reverted the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to default-off to give a full year from deprecation announcement in 1.29 to clearing the field by default, per the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/). ([#126720](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126720), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Architecture and Node]
- ServiceAccount metadata.annotations[kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets]: deprecated since v1.32; no removal deadline. Prefer separate namespaces to isolate access to mounted secrets. ([#128396](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128396), [@ritazh](https://github.com/ritazh)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI and Testing]

### API Change

- **ACTION REQUIRED** for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  `PodEligibleToPreemptOthers` in the `preemption` interface now includes `ctx` in the parameters.
  Please update your plugins' implementation accordingly. ([#126465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126465), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Changed NodeToStatusMap from a map to a struct and exposed methods to access the entries. Added absentNodesStatus, which informs the status of nodes that are absent in the map. For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, ensure to update the usage of NodeToStatusMap. Additionally, NodeToStatusMap should eventually be renamed to NodeToStatusReader. ([#126022](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126022), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Node, Scheduling, and Testing]
 
- A new /resize subresource was added to request pod resource resizing. Update your k8s client code to utilize the /resize subresource for Pod resizing operations. ([#128266](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128266), [@AnishShah](https://github.com/AnishShah)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- A new feature that allows unsafe deletion of corrupt resources has been added, it is disabled by default, 
  and it can be enabled by setting the option `--feature-gates=AllowUnsafeMalformedObjectDeletion=true`. 
  It comes with an API change, a new delete option `ignoreStoreReadErrorWithClusterBreakingPotential` has
  been introduced, it is not set by default, this maintains backward compatibility. 
  In order to perform an unsafe deletion of a corrupt resource, the user must enable the option for the delete
  request. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be successfully retrieved from the storage due to
  a) transformation error e.g. decryption failure, or b) the object failed to decode. Normal deletion flow is
  attempted first, and if it fails with a corrupt resource error then it triggers unsafe delete.
  In addition, when this feature is enabled, the 'details' field of 'Status' from the LIST response 
  includes information that identifies the corrupt object(s).
  NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, and skips precondition checks.
  WARNING: this may break the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted, if it relies on
  the normal deletion flow, so cluster breaking consequences apply. ([#127513](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127513), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd, Node and Testing]
- Added `singleProcessOOMKill` flag to the kubelet configuration. Setting that to true enable single process OOM killing in cgroups v2. In this mode, if a single process is OOM killed within a container, the remaining processes will not be OOM killed. ([#126096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126096), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k)) [SIG API Machinery, Node, Testing and Windows]
- Added a `/flagz` endpoint for kube-apiserver endpoint. ([#127581](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127581), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth and Instrumentation]
- Added a `Stream` field to `PodLogOptions`, which allows clients to request certain log stream (stdout or stderr) of the container.
  Please also note that the combination of a specific `Stream` and `TailLines` is not supported. ([#127360](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127360), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Node, Release and Testing]
- Added alpha support for asynchronous Pod preemption.
  When the `SchedulerAsyncPreemption` feature gate is enabled, the scheduler now runs API calls to trigger preemptions asynchronously for better performance. ([#128170](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128170), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Added driver-owned fields in `ResourceClaim.Status` to report device status data for each allocated device. ([#128240](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128240), [@LionelJouin](https://github.com/LionelJouin)) [SIG API Machinery, Network, Node and Testing]
- Added enforcement of an upper cost bound for DRA evaluations of CEL. The API server and scheduler now enforce an upper bound on the cost and runtime steps required for evaluating a CEL expression. ([#128101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128101), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Added the ability to change the maximum backoff delay accrued between container restarts for a node for containers in `CrashLoopBackOff`. To set this for a node, turn on the feature gate `KubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` and set the `CrashLoopBackOff.MaxContainerRestartPeriod ` field between `"1s"` and `"300s"` in your [kubelet config file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/). ([#128374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128374), [@lauralorenz](https://github.com/lauralorenz)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Allow for Pod search domains to be a single dot `.` or contain an underscore `_` ([#127167](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127167), [@adrianmoisey](https://github.com/adrianmoisey)) [SIG Apps, Network and Testing]
- Annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/cronjob-scheduled-timestamp` added to Job objects scheduled from CronJobs is promoted to stable. ([#128336](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128336), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh))
- Apply fsGroup policy for ReadWriteOncePod volumes. ([#128244](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128244), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied)) [SIG Storage and Testing]
- Changed the Pod API to support `resources` at `spec` level for pod-level resources. ([#128407](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128407), [@ndixita](https://github.com/ndixita)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- ContainerStatus.AllocatedResources is now guarded by a separate feature gate, InPlacePodVerticalSaclingAllocatedStatus ([#128377](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128377), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Coordination.v1alpha1 API is dropped and replaced with coordination.v1alpha2. Old coordination.v1alpha1 types must be deleted before upgrade ([#127857](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127857), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: Restricted the length of opaque device configuration parameters. At admission time, Kubernetes enforces a 10KiB size limit. ([#128601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128601), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: scheduling pods is up to 16x faster, depending on the scenario. Scheduling throughput depends a lot on cluster utilization. It is higher for lightly loaded clusters with free resources and gets lower when the cluster utilization increases. ([#127277](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127277), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- DRA: the `DeviceRequestAllocationResult` struct now has an "AdminAccess" field which should be used instead of the corresponding field in the `DeviceRequest` field when dealing with an allocation. If a device is only allocated for admin access, allocating it again for normal usage is now supported, as originally intended. To allow admin access, starting with 1.32 the `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate must be enabled. ([#127266](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127266), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Network, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Disallow `k8s.io` and `kubernetes.io` namespaced extra key in structured authentication configuration. ([#126553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126553), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixed a bug in the `NestedNumberAsFloat64` Unstructured field accessor that could have caused it to return rounded float64 values instead of errors when accessing very large int64 values. ([#128099](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128099), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- Fixed the bug where `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` of the pod will always be overwritten by the MaxPodGracePeriodSeconds of the soft eviction, you can enable the `AllowOverwriteTerminationGracePeriodSeconds` feature gate, which will restore the previous behavior.  If you do need to set this, please file an issue with the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand why you needed it. ([#122890](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122890), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Node and Testing]
- Graduate Job's `ManagedBy` field to beta. ([#127402](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127402), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Implemented a new, alpha `seLinuxChangePolicy` field within a Pod-level `securityContext`, under SELinuxChangePolicy feature gate. This field allows for opting out from mounting Pod volumes with SELinux label when SELinuxMount feature is enabled (it is alpha and disabled by default now).
  Please see [the KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1710-selinux-relabeling#story-3-cluster-upgrade) how we expect to warn users before any SELinux behavior changes and how they can opt-out before. Note that this field and feature gate is useful only with clusters that run with SELinux enabled. No action is required on clusters without SELinux. ([#127981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127981), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Introduced `v1alpha1` API for mutating admission policies, enabling extensible #     admission control via CEL expressions (KEP  3962: Mutating Admission Policies). #     To use, enable the `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` feature gate and the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1` #     API via `--runtime-config`. ([#127134](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127134), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Etcd and Testing]
- Introduced compressible resource setting on system reserved and kube reserved slices. ([#125982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125982), [@harche](https://github.com/harche))
- kube-apiserver: Promoted the `StructuredAuthorizationConfiguration` feature gate to GA. The `--authorization-config` flag now accepts `AuthorizationConfiguration` in version `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1` (with no changes from `apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1`). ([#128172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128172), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- kube-proxy now reconciles Service/Endpoint changes with conntrack table and cleans up only stale UDP flow entries ([#127318](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127318), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman)) [SIG Network and Windows]
- kube-scheduler removed `AzureDiskLimits` ,`CinderLimits` `EBSLimits` and `GCEPDLimits` plugin. Given the corresponding CSI driver reports how many volumes a node can handle in NodeGetInfoResponse, the kubelet stores this limit in CSINode and the scheduler then knows the limit of the driver on the node. Removed plugins AzureDiskLimits, CinderLimits, EBSLimits and GCEPDLimits if you explicitly enabled them in the scheduler config. ([#124003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124003), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- kubelet: the `--image-credential-provider-config` file was loaded with strict deserialization, which failed if the config file contained duplicate or unknown fields. This protected against accidentally running with malformed config files, unindented files, or typos in field names, and it prevented unexpected behavior. ([#128062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128062), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- NodeRestriction admission now validates the audience value that kubelet is requesting a service account token for is part of the pod spec volume. This change is introduced with a new kube-apiserver featuregate `ServiceAccountNodeAudienceRestriction` that's enabled by default. ([#128077](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128077), [@aramase](https://github.com/aramase)) [SIG Auth, Storage and Testing]
- Promoted `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` to stable; the feature was enabled by default. The `--feature-gates=CustomResourceFieldSelectors=true` flag was no longer needed on kube-apiserver binaries and would be removed in a future release. ([#127673](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127673), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Promoted feature gate `StatefulSetAutoDeletePVC` from beta to stable. ([#128247](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128247), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Testing]
- Removed all support for _classic_ dynamic resource allocation (DRA). The `DRAControlPlaneController` feature gate, formerly alpha, is no longer available. Kubernetes now only uses the _structured parameters_ model (also alpha) for allocating dynamic resources to Pods.
  
  if and only if classic DRA was enabled in a cluster, remove all workloads (pods, app deployments, etc. ) which depend on classic DRA and make sure that all PodSchedulingContext resources are gone before upgrading. PodSchedulingContext resources cannot be removed through the apiserver after an upgrade and workloads would not work properly. ([#128003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128003), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Removed generally available feature gate `HPAContainerMetrics` ([#126862](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126862), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Autoscaling]
- Removed restrictions on subresource flag in kubectl commands ([#128296](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128296), [@AnishShah](https://github.com/AnishShah)) [SIG CLI]
- Revised the kubelet API Authorization with new subresources, that allow finer-grained authorization checks and access control for kubelet endpoints.
  Provided you enable the `KubeletFineGrainedAuthz` feature gate, you can access kubelet's `/healthz` endpoint by granting the caller `nodes/helathz` permission in RBAC.
  Similarly you can also access  kubelet's `/pods` endpoint to fetch a list of Pods bound to that node by granting the caller `nodes/pods` permission in RBAC.
  Similarly you can also access kubelet's `/configz` endpoint to fetch kubelet's configuration by granting the caller `nodes/configz` permission in RBAC.
  You can still access kubelet's `/healthz`, `/pods` and `/configz` by granting the caller `nodes/proxy` permission in RBAC but that also grants the caller permissions to exec, run and attach to containers on the nodes and doing so does not follow the least privilege principle. Granting callers more permissions than they need can give attackers an opportunity to escalate privileges. ([#126347](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126347), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle and Node]
- The core functionality of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) got promoted to beta. No action is required when *upgrading*, the previous v1alpha3 API is still supported, so existing deployments and DRA drivers based on v1alpha3 continue to work. *Downgrading* from 1.32 to 1.31 with DRA resources in the cluster (resourceclaims, resourceclaimtemplates, deviceclasses, resourceslices) is *not* supported because the new v1beta1 is used as storage version and not readable by 1.31. ([#127511](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127511), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- The default value for node-monitor-grace-period has been increased to 50s (earlier 40s) (Ref - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121793) ([#126287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126287), [@devppratik](https://github.com/devppratik)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The resource/v1alpha3.ResourceSliceList filed which should have been named "metadata" but was instead named "listMeta" is now properly "metadata". ([#126749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126749), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- The synthetic "Bookmark" event for the watch stream requests will now include a new annotation: `kubernetes.io/initial-events-list-blueprint`. THe annotation contains an empty, versioned list that is encoded in the requested format (such as protobuf, JSON, or CBOR), then base64-encoded and stored as a string. ([#127587](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127587), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions.
  Name format CEL library is supported in new expressions. ([#126977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126977), [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Updated incorrect description of persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy ([#126545](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126545), [@yangjunmyfm192085](https://github.com/yangjunmyfm192085)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and CLI]
- X.509 client certificate authentication to the kube-apiserver now produces credential IDs (derived from the certificate's signature) , for use in audit logging. ([#125634](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125634), [@ahmedtd](https://github.com/ahmedtd)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]

### Feature

- Added Windows support for the node memory manager. ([#128560](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128560), [@marosset](https://github.com/marosset)) [SIG Node and Windows]
- Added `--concurrent-daemonset-syncs` command line flag to kube-controller-manager. This value sets the number of workers for the daemonset controller. ([#128444](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128444), [@tosi3k](https://github.com/tosi3k))
- Added a `/statusz` endpoint for the kube-apiserver endpoint. ([#125577](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125577), [@richabanker](https://github.com/richabanker)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Network, Node and Testing]
- Added a health check for the device plugin gRPC registration server. When the registration server is down, kubelet is marked as unhealthy. If systemd watchdog is configured, this will result in a kubelet restart. ([#128432](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128432), [@zhifei92](https://github.com/zhifei92)) [SIG Node]
- Added a kubelet metric `container_aligned_compute_resources_count`  to report the count of containers getting aligned compute resources. ([#127155](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127155), [@ffromani](https://github.com/ffromani)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Added a kubelet metrics to report informations about the cpu pools managed by cpumanager when the static policy is in use. ([#127506](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127506), [@ffromani](https://github.com/ffromani)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Added a new controller, volumeattributesclass-protection-controller, into the kube-controller-manager.
  The new controller manages a protective finalizer on VolumeAttributesClass objects. ([#123549](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123549), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth and Storage]
- Added a new option `strict-cpu-reservation` for CPU Manager static policy. When this option is enabled, CPU cores in `reservedSystemCPUs` will be strictly used for system daemons and interrupt processing no longer available for any workload. ([#127483](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127483), [@jingczhang](https://github.com/jingczhang)) [SIG Node]
- Added a one-time random duration of up to 50% of kubelet's `nodeStatusReportFrequency` to help spread the node status update load evenly over time. ([#128640](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128640), [@mengqiy](https://github.com/mengqiy))
- Added an option to enable leader election in local-up-cluster.sh via the LEADER_ELECT CLI flag. ([#127786](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127786), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree))
- Added kubelet support for systemd watchdog integration. With this enabled, systemd can automatically recover a hung kubelet. ([#127566](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566), [@zhifei92](https://github.com/zhifei92)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Node and Testing]
- Added metrics to measure the latency of DRA Node operations and DRA GRPC calls ([#127146](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127146), [@bart0sh](https://github.com/bart0sh)) [SIG Instrumentation, Network, Node, and Testing]
- Added new functionality to the Go client code (`client-go`) library. The `List()` method for the metadata client allows enabling API streaming when fetching collections; this improves performance when listing many objects.
  To request this behavior, your client software must enable the `WatchListClient` client-go feature gate. Additionally, streaming is only available if supported by the cluster; the API server that you connect to must also support streaming.
  If the API server does not support or allow streaming, then `client-go` falls back to fetching the collection using the **list** API verb. ([#127388](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127388), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Added preemptionPolicy field when using `kubectl get PriorityClass -owide` ([#126529](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126529), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG CLI]
- Added status for extended Pod resources within the `status.containerStatuses[].resources` field. ([#124227](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124227), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Added support to the kube-apiserver for an alpha feature enabling external signing of service account tokens and fetching of public verifying keys, by enabling the Alpha `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature gate and specifying `--service-account-signing-endpoint`. The flag value can either be the location of a Unix domain socket on a filesystem, or be prefixed with an @ symbol and name a Unix domain socket in the abstract socket namespace. ([#128190](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128190), [@HarshalNeelkamal](https://github.com/HarshalNeelkamal)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Etcd, Instrumentation, Node, Release and Testing]
- Added the feature gate CBORServingAndStorage to allow CBOR as the encoding for API request and response bodies, and as the storage encoding for custom resources. Clients must opt in; programs built with client-go can do this using the client-go feature gates ClientsAllowCBOR and ClientsPreferCBOR. ([#128539](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128539), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery, Etcd and Testing]
- Adopted a new implementation of watch caches for **list** verbs, using a btree data structure. The new implementation is active by default; you can opt out by disabling the `BtreeWatchCache` feature gate. ([#128415](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128415), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Cloud Provider]
- Allows PreStop lifecycle handler's sleep action to have a zero value ([#127094](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127094), [@sreeram-venkitesh](https://github.com/sreeram-venkitesh)) [SIG Apps, Node and Testing]
- CRI: Added a field to support CPU affinity on Windows. ([#124285](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124285), [@kiashok](https://github.com/kiashok)) [SIG Node and Windows]
- Changed OOM score adjustment calculation for sidecar containers: the OOM adjustment for these containers will match or fall below the OOM score adjustment of regular containers in the Pod. ([#128029](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128029), [@bouaouda-achraf](https://github.com/bouaouda-achraf))
- Client-go/rest: contextual logging of request/response with accurate source code location of the caller ([#126999](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126999), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- DRA: The resource claim controller now maintains metrics about the total number of `ResourceClaims` and the number of allocated `ResourceClaims`. ([#127661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127661), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Apps, Instrumentation and Node]
- Enabled graceful shutdown feature for Windows node ([#127404](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127404), [@zylxjtu](https://github.com/zylxjtu)) [SIG Node, Testing and Windows]
- Enabled kube-controller-manager '--concurrent-job-syncs' flag works on orphan Pod processors ([#126567](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126567), [@fusida](https://github.com/fusida)) [SIG Apps]
- Ensured resizing for Guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests on nodes with static CPU & Memory policy configured is not allowed for the beta release of in-place resize. The feature gate `InPlacePodVerticalScalingExclusiveCPUs` defaults to `false`, but can be enabled to unblock development on ([#127262](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127262), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG Node]. ([#128287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128287), [@esotsal](https://github.com/esotsal)) [SIG Node, Release and Testing]
- Extend discovery GroupManager with Group lister interface ([#127524](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127524), [@mjudeikis](https://github.com/mjudeikis)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fix: Avoid overwriting in-pod vertical scaling updates on systemd daemon reloads when using systemd ([#124216](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124216), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG Node]
- Fixed an issue where kubectl doesn't print image volume when kubectl describe a pod with that volume. ([#126706](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126706), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))

- Documented the `--for=create` option to `kubectl wait` ([#127327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127327), [@ryanwinter](https://github.com/ryanwinter)) [SIG CLI]
- Fixed documentation for the `apiserver_admission_webhook_fail_open_count` and `apiserver_admission_webhook_request_total` metrics. The `type` label can have a value of "admit", not "mutating".

### Bug or Regression

- 1. When the kubelet constructs the CRI mounts for the container which references an `image` volume source type, it passes the missing mount attributes to the CRI implementation, including `readOnly`, `propagation`, and `recursiveReadOnly`. When the readOnly field of the containerMount is explicitly set to false, the kubelet will now take the `readOnly`as true to the CRI implementation because the image volume plugin requires the mount to be read-only. 
  2. Fixed a bug where the pod is unexpectedly running when the `image` volume source type is used and mounted to `/etc/hosts` in the container. ([#126806](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126806), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node and Storage]

- Fixed a bug in the garbage collector controller which could block indefinitely due to a cache sync failure. This fix allows the garbage collector to eventually continue garbage collecting other resources if a given resource cannot be listed or watched.
