# Kubernetes 1.11 Release Notes

This document is for release notes for Kubernetes 1.11. These release notes are initially generated from commit messages, and are sorted based on the release note tag.

Commits should be tagged as follows:

**/release-note**

This tag is for changes that are user-facing. For example, API changes or CLI flag changes belong in this category. Fixed bugs that affect the user experience should also be in this category.

**/release-note-none**

This tag is for changes that don't affect the user experience, such as behind-the-scenes improvements that only other Kubernetes developers will notice. These notes will appear in the changelog but not the release notes.

* Deprecating Heapster: as part of the ongoing efforts to moving to the new Kubernetes monitoring model, Heapster is now deprecated.  Clusters still using it for autoscaling should be migrated over to [metrics-server ](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server) and the [custom metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics).  See the deprecation note below for more information on this.  Clusters using Heapster for transfering metrics into long-term storage should consider using their metric solution's native Kubernetes support, if present, or should consider alternative solutions.

### sig-multicluster


### sig-network

- IPVS-based kube-proxy is GA now

### sig-node


### sig-openstack


### sig-scalability


### sig-scheduling


### sig-service-catalog


### sig-storage


### sig-windows


## Before Upgrading

* Default mount propagation has changed from "HostToContainer" ("rslave" in Linux terminology), as it was in 1.10, to "None" ("private") to match the behavior in 1.9 and earlier releases. "HostToContainer" as a default caused regressions in some pods. ([#62462](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62462), [@jsafrane](https://github.com/jsafrane))
* The kube-apiserver `--storage-version` flag has been removed; you must use `--storage-versions` instead. ([#61453](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61453), [@hzxuzhonghu](https://github.com/hzxuzhonghu))
* [Pod priority and preemption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/)
is enabled by default. Even if you don't plan to use this feature,
you might need to take some action right after upgrading.
In multi-tenant clusters where not all users are trusted, you are advised to create appropriate
amount of quota for two default priority classes, `system-cluster-critical` and
`system-node-critical`. These two priority classes are added to clusters by default.
[ResourceQuota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
should be created to limit users from creating Pods at these priorities if not all users of your
cluster are trusted. We do not advise disabling this feature since critical system Pods rely on
the scheduler preemption to be scheduled when cluster is under resource pressure.
 
### Pending

* client-go developers must switch to the new dynamic client. This new client is easier to use, and the old one is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. **(EDITOR'S NOTE:  If the old client is deprecated, it's still there, so do developers actually HAVE to switch, and if so, why?)** (#62913, @deads2k)
* Add warnings that authors of aggregated API servers must not rely on authorization being done by the kube-apiserver. **(EDITOR'S NOTE: Why? And is this note that warnings must be added, or is this note the warning?)** ([#61349](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61349), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts))
* kubeadm: Remove the `.CloudProvider` and `.PrivilegedPods` configuration option (#63866, @luxas)
* kubeadm now uses an upgraded API version for the configuration file, `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1alpha2`. kubeadm in v1.11 will still be able to read `v1alpha1` configuration, and will automatically convert the configuration to `v1alpha2` internally and when storing the configuration in the ConfigMap in the cluster. (#63788, @luxas)
* The annotation `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints` is deprecated.  Users should use Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses instead. (#63742, @thockin)
* avoid duplicate status in audit events (#62695, @CaoShuFeng)
* You must now specify Node.Spec.ConfigSource.ConfigMap.KubeletConfigKey when using dynamic Kubelet config to tell the Kubelet which key of the ConfigMap identifies its config file. (#59847, @mtaufen)
* Kubernetes version command line parameter in kubeadm has been updated to drop an unnecessary redirection from ci/latest.txt to ci-cross/latest.txt. Users should know exactly where the builds are stored on Google Cloud storage buckets from now on. For example for 1.9 and 1.10, users can specify ci/latest-1.9 and ci/latest-1.10 as the CI build jobs what build images correctly updates those. The CI jobs for master update the ci-cross/latest location, so if you are looking for latest master builds, then the correct parameter to use would be ci-cross/latest. (#63504, @dims)
* GC is now bound by QPS (it wasn't before) and so if you need more QPS to avoid ratelimiting GC, you'll have to set it. (#63657, @shyamjvs)
* [action required] TODO (#64792, @luxas)
* kubeadm: Update the dropin for the kubelet in v1.11 (#64780, @luxas)
* kubeadm: Let the `--node-name` flag flow down to `--hostname-override` for the kubelet (#64706, @liztio)
* [action required] kubeadm: The Token-related fields in the `MasterConfiguration` object have now been refactored. Instead of the top-level `.Token`, `.TokenTTL`, `.TokenUsages`, `.TokenGroups` fields, there is now a `BootstrapTokens` slice of `BootstrapToken` objects that support the same features under the `.Token`, `.TTL`, `.Usages`, `.Groups` fields. (#64408, @luxas)
* [action required] `.NodeName` and `.CRISocket` in the `MasterConfiguration` and `NodeConfiguration` v1alpha1 API objects are now `.NodeRegistration.Name` and `.NodeRegistration.CRISocket` respectively in the v1alpha2 API. The `.NoTaintMaster` field has been removed in the v1alpha2 API. (#64210, @luxas)
* (ACTION REQUIRED) PersisntVolumeLabel admission controller is now disabled by default. If you depend on this feature (AWS/GCE) then ensure it is added to the `--enable-admission-plugins` flag on the kube-apiserver. (#64326, @andrewsykim)
* [action required] kubeadm: The `:Etcd` struct has been refactored in the v1alpha2 API. All the options now reside under either `.Etcd.Local` or `.Etcd.External`. Automatic conversions from the v1alpha1 API are supported. (#64066, @luxas)
* [action required] kubeadm: kubelets in kubeadm clusters now disable the readonly port (10255). If you're relying on unauthenticated access to the readonly port, please switch to using the secure port (10250). Instead, you can now use ServiceAccount tokens when talking to the secure port, which will make it easier to get access to e.g. the `/metrics` endpoint of the kubelet securely. (#64187, @luxas)
* [action required] kubeadm: Support for `.AuthorizationModes` in the kubeadm v1alpha2 API has been removed. Instead, you can use the `.APIServerExtraArgs` and `.APIServerExtraVolumes` fields to achieve the same effect. Files using the v1alpha1 API and setting this field will be automatically upgraded to this v1alpha2 API and the information will be preserved. (#64068, @luxas)
* [action required] The formerly publicly-available cAdvisor web UI that the kubelet ran on port 4194 by default is now turned off by default. The flag configuring what port to run this UI on `--cadvisor-port` was deprecated in v1.10. Now the default is `--cadvisor-port=0`, in other words, to not run the web server. The recommended way to run cAdvisor if you still need it, is via a DaemonSet. The `--cadvisor-port` will be removed in v1.12 (#63881, @luxas)
* [action required] kubeadm: The `.ImagePullPolicy` field has been removed in the v1alpha2 API version. Instead it's set statically to `IfNotPresent` for all required images. If you want to always pull the latest images before cluster init (like what `Always` would do), run `kubeadm config images pull` before each `kubeadm init`. If you don't want the kubelet to pull any images at `kubeadm init` time, as you for instance don't have an internet connection, you can also run `kubeadm config images pull` before `kubeadm init` or side-load the images some other way (e.g. `docker load -i image.tar`). Having the images locally cached will result in no pull at runtime, which makes it possible to run without any internet connection. (#64096, @luxas)
*  kubeadm: Remove the `.CloudProvider` and `.PrivilegedPods` configuration option (#63866, @luxas)
* [action required] kubeadm now uses an upgraded API version for the configuration file, `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1alpha2`. kubeadm in v1.11 will still be able to read `v1alpha1` configuration, and will automatically convert the configuration to `v1alpha2` internally and when storing the configuration in the ConfigMap in the cluster. (#63788, @luxas)
* The annotation `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints` is deprecated.  Users should use Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses instead. (#63742, @thockin)
* avoid duplicate status in audit events (#62695, @CaoShuFeng)


#### New Deprecations

* `--show-all`, which only affected pods, and even then only for human readable/non-API printers, is inert in v1.11, and will be removed in a future release. ([#60793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60793), [@charrywanganthony](https://github.com/charrywanganthony))
* Deprecate kubectl rolling-update  (#61285, @soltysh)
* Deprecate InfluxDB cluster monitoring (#62328, @serathius)
* The annotation `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints` is deprecated.  Users should use Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses instead. (#63742, @thockin)
* kube-apiserver: the default `--endpoint-reconciler-type` is now `lease`. The `master-count` endpoint reconciler type is deprecated and will be removed in 1.13. (#63383, @liggitt)
* OpenStack built-in cloud provider is now deprecated. Please use the external cloud provider for OpenStack. (#63524, @dims)
* The Kubelet's deprecated --allow-privileged flag now defaults to true. This enables users to stop setting --allow-privileged in order to transition to PodSecurityPolicy. Previously, users had to continue setting --allow-privileged, because the default was false. (#63442, @mtaufen)
* The old dynamic client has been replaced by a new one.  The previous dynamic client will exist for one release in `client-go/deprecated-dynamic`.  Switch as soon as possible. (#63446, @deads2k)
* Heapster is now deprecated, and support for setting up Heapster in Kubernetes and consuming it from the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will be removed in a future release.  If you are currently manually setting `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients=false` on the controller-manager, please migrate to metrics-server, and set the flag back to its default (`true`).  For more information on the Heapster deprecation, see [the Heapster deprecation timeline](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md).


##### Pending

* in-tree support for openstack credentials is now deprecated. please use the "client-keystone-auth" from the cloud-provider-openstack repository. details on how to use this new capability is documented here - https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/master/docs/using-client-keystone-auth.md (#64346, @dims)
* core v1: deprecate the gitRepo volume type (#63445, @ericchiang)
* Deprecate InfluxDB cluster monitoring (#62328, @serathius)
* The annotation `service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints` is deprecated.  Users should use Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses instead. (#63742, @thockin)
* The old dynamic client has been replaced by a new one.  The previous dynamic client will exist for one release in `client-go/deprecated-dynamic`.  Switch as soon as possible. (#63446, @deads2k)
* OpenStack built-in cloud provider is now deprecated. Please use the external cloud provider for OpenStack. (#63524, @dims)
* kube-apiserver: the default `--endpoint-reconciler-type` is now `lease`. The `master-count` endpoint reconciler type is deprecated and will be removed in 1.13. (#63383, @liggitt)



#### Removed Deprecations

* --include-extended-apis, which was deprecated back in [#32894](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/32894), has been removed. ([#62803](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62803), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))
* Kubelets will no longer set `externalID` in their node spec. ([#61877](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61877), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))
* The initresource admission plugin has been removed. ([#58784](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58784), [@wackxu](https://github.com/wackxu))

* The deprecated --mode flag in check-network-mode has been removed. ([#60102](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60102), [@satyasm](https://github.com/satyasm))
* Support for the `alpha.kubernetes.io/nvidia-gpu` resource, which was deprecated in 1.10, has been removed. Please use the resource exposed by DevicePlugins instead (`nvidia.com/gpu`). ([#61498](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61498), [@mindprince](https://github.com/mindprince))
* The kube-cloud-controller-manager flag --service-account-private-key-file has been removed. ([#60875](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60875), [@charrywanganthony](https://github.com/charrywanganthony))

**Pending**
* The rknetes code, which was deprecated in 1.10, has been removed. **(What should be used instead? CRI?)** ([#61432](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61432), [@filbranden](https://github.com/filbranden))
* DaemonSet scheduling associated with the alpha ScheduleDaemonSetPods feature flag has been removed from the 1.10 release. See https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/548 for feature status. **(EDITOR'S NOTE: Should this be 1.11 or is this a leftover change that didn't quite make it?)** ([#61411](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61411), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
* The METADATA_AGENT_VERSION configuration option has been removed. **(EDITOR'S NOTE: From where? What should be used instead?)** (#63000, @kawych)

#### Alpha, Beta, Stable

* The `PriorityClass` API is promoted to `scheduling.k8s.io/v1beta1` (#63100, @ravisantoshgudimetla)

**Pending**

## Other Notable Changes

### Sig API-Machinery
* The kubeadm config option `API.ControlPlaneEndpoint` has been extended to take an optional port which may differ from the apiserver's bind port. ([#62314](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62314), [@rjosephwright](https://github.com/rjosephwright))

#### Pending

* Orphan delete is now supported for CustomResources. (#63386, @roycaihw)
* Meta data of CustomResources is now pruned and schema checked during deserialization of requests and when read from etcd. In the former case, invalid meta data is rejected, in the latter it is dropped from the CustomResource objects. (#64267, @sttts)
* The kube-apiserver openapi doc now includes extensions identifying APIService and CustomResourceDefinition kinds. (#64174, @liggitt)
* Subresources for CustomResources is now beta and enabled by default. With this, updates to the `/status` subresource will disallow updates to all fields other than `.status` (not just `.spec` and `.metadata` as before). Also, `required` and `description` can be used at the root of the CRD OpenAPI validation schema when the `/status` subresource is enabled. (#63598, @nikhita)
* The `/status` subresource for CustomResourceDefinitions now supports GET and PATCH. (#63619, @roycaihw)
* _[obsolete]_ When updating /status subresource of a custom resource, only the value at the `.status` subpath for the update is considered. (#63385, @CaoShuFeng)
* Add a way to pass extra arguments to etcd. (#63961, @mborsz)
* Label ExternalEtcdClientCertificates can be used for ignoring all preflight check issues related to client certificate files for external etcd. (#64269, @kad)
* Add Establishing Controller on CRDs to avoid race between Established condition and CRs actually served. In HA setups, the Established condition is delayed by 5 seconds. (#63068, @xmudrii)
* Add spec.additionalPrinterColumns to CRDs to define server side printing columns. (#60991, @sttts)
* Multiple versions without conversions is now possible for CustomResources. (#63830, @mbohlool)
* _[obsolete]_ Allow "required" and "description" to be used at the CRD OpenAPI validation schema root when the /status subresource is enabled. (#63533, @sttts)
* The CRD OpenAPI v3 specification for validation now allows `additionalProperties`, which are mutually exclusive to `properties`. ([#62333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62333), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts))


### Sig Auth
* RBAC information is now included in audit logs via audit.Event annotations: ([#58807](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58807), [@CaoShuFeng](https://github.com/CaoShuFeng))
    * authorization.k8s.io/decision = {allow, forbid}
    * authorization.k8s.io/reason = human-readable reason for the decision
* `kubectl certificate approve|deny` will not modify an already approved or denied CSR unless the `--force` flag is provided. ([#61971](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61971), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
* The `--bootstrap-kubeconfig` argument to Kubelet previously created the first bootstrap client credentials in the certificates directory as `kubelet-client.key` and `kubelet-client.crt`.  Subsequent certificates created by cert rotation were created in a combined PEM file that was atomically rotated as `kubelet-client-DATE.pem` in that directory, which meant clients relying on the `node.kubeconfig` generated by bootstrapping would never use a rotated cert.  The initial bootstrap certificate is now generated into the cert directory as a PEM file and symlinked to `kubelet-client-current.pem` so that the generated kubeconfig remains valid after rotation. (#62152, @smarterclayton)

#### Pending 

* owner references can be set during creation without deletion power (#63403, @deads2k)
* Implements OIDC distributed claims. (#63213, @filmil)

### Sig Azure
* Azure cloud provider now supports standard SKU load balancer and public IP. To use it, set the cloud provider config with
    {
       "loadBalancerSku": "standard",
       "excludeMasterFromStandardLB": true,
    }
If excludeMasterFromStandardLB is not set, it will be default to true, which means master nodes are excluded from the standard load balancer. Also note that the standard load balancer doesn't work with annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-mode`. This is because all nodes (except master) are added as the loadbalancer backends.
([#61884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61884), [#62707](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62707), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))
* The Azure cloud provider now supports specifying allowed service tags by annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-allowed-service-tags` ([#61467](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61467), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))

* apply global flag "context" for kubectl config view --minify (#64608, @dixudx)
* kubectl built for darwin from darwin now enables cgo to use the system-native C libraries for DNS resolution. Cross-compiled kubectl (e.g. from an official kubernetes release) still uses the go-native netgo DNS implementation.  (#64219, @ixdy)
* kubectl apply --prune supports CronJob resource.  (#62991, @tomoe)
* The --dry-run flag has been enabled for kubectl auth reconcile (#64458, @mrogers950)
* kubectl delete does not use reapers for removing objects anymore, but relies on server-side GC entirely (#63979, @soltysh)
* kubectl: This client version requires the `apps/v1` APIs, so it will not work against a cluster version older than v1.9.0. Note that kubectl only guarantees compatibility with clusters that are +/-1 minor version away. (#61419, @enisoc)

* `kubectl create [secret | configmap] --from-file` now works on Windows with fully-qualified paths (#63439, @liggitt)
* Use /usr/bin/env in all script shebangs to increase portability. (#62657, @matthyx)



### Sig Cluster-Lifecycle
* Phase `kubeadm alpha phase kubelet` has been added to support dynamic kubelet configuration in kubeadm. ([#57224](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57224), [@xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))
* `kubeadm alpha phase kubeconfig user` now supports the specification of groups (organizations) in a client certificate. ([#62627](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62627), [@xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))
* The --cluster-name parameter has been added to kubeadm init, enabling users to specify the cluster name in kubeconfig. ([#60852](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60852), [@karan](https://github.com/karan))
* The logging feature for kubeadm commands now supports a verbosity setting. ([#57661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57661), [@vbmade2000](https://github.com/vbmade2000))
* kubeadm config can now override the Node CIDR Mask Size passed to kube-controller-manager. ([#61705](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61705), [@jstangroome](https://github.com/jstangroome))
* kubeadm now has a join timeout that can be controlled via the discoveryTimeout config option (set to 5 minutes by default). ([#60983](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60983), [@rosti](https://github.com/rosti))
* kubeadm: Added the writable boolean option to kubeadm config. The option works on a per-volume basis for *ExtraVolumes* config keys. ([#60428](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60428), [@rosti](https://github.com/rosti))
* Fixed a configuration error when upgrading kubeadm from 1.9 to 1.10+; Kubernetes must have the same major and minor versions as the kubeadm library. ([#62568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62568), [@liztio](https://github.com/liztio))

* kubeadm: when starting the API server use the arguments --enable-admission-plugins and --disable-admission-plugins instead of the deprecated --admission-control. (#64165, @neolit123)
* Correct the way we reset containers and pods in kubeadm via crictl (#63862, @runcom)
* "kubeadm init" now writes a structured and versioned kubelet ComponentConfiguration file to `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` and an environment file with runtime flags (you can source this file in the systemd kubelet dropin) to `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env`. (#63887, @luxas)
* kubeadm: A `kubeadm config print-default` command has now been added that you can use as a starting point when writing your own kubeadm configuration files (#63969, @luxas)
* Update kubeadm's minimum supported kubernetes in v1.11.x to 1.10 (#63920, @dixudx)
* kubeadm has removed `.Etcd.SelfHosting` from its configuration API. It was never used in practice. (#63871, @luxas)
* adds the `kubeadm upgrade diff` command to show how static pod manifests will be changed by an upgrade. (#63930, @liztio)

* Adds a list-images subcommand to kubeadm that lists required images for a kubeadm install. (#63450, @chuckha)
* Kubernetes version command line parameter in kubeadm has been updated to drop an unnecessary redirection from ci/latest.txt to ci-cross/latest.txt. Users should know exactly where the builds are stored on Google Cloud storage buckets from now on. For example for 1.9 and 1.10, users can specify ci/latest-1.9 and ci/latest-1.10 as the CI build jobs what build images correctly updates those. The CI jobs for master update the ci-cross/latest location, so if you are looking for latest master builds, then the correct parameter to use would be ci-cross/latest. (#63504, @dims)
* Search standard KubeConfig file locations when using `kubeadm token` without `--kubeconfig`. (#62850, @neolit123)

* Supported nodeSelector.matchFields (node's `metadata.node`) in scheduler. (#62453, @k82cn)
* Kubelet will set extended resource capacity to zero after it restarts. If the extended resource is exported by a device plugin, its capacity will change to a valid value after the device plugin re-connects with the Kubelet. If the extended resource is exported by an external component through direct node status capacity patching, the component should repatch the field after kubelet becomes ready again. During the time gap, pods previously assigned with such resources may fail kubelet admission but their controller should create new pods in response to such failures. (#64784, @jiayingz)
* The Sysctls experimental feature has been promoted to beta (enabled by default via the `Sysctls` feature flag). PodSecurityPolicy and Pod objects now have fields for specifying and controlling sysctls. Alpha sysctl annotations will be ignored by 1.11+ kubelets.

* Add probe based mechanism for kubelet plugin discovery (#63328, @vikaschoudhary16)
* The dynamic Kubelet config feature is now beta, and the DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate is on by default. In order to use dynamic Kubelet config, ensure that the Kubelet's --dynamic-config-dir option is set.  (#64275, @mtaufen)
* Add reason message logs for non-exist Azure resources (#64248, @feiskyer)
* The Kubelet now exports metrics that report the assigned (node_config_assigned), last-known-good (node_config_last_known_good), and active (node_config_active) config sources, and a metric indicating whether the node is experiencing a config-related error (node_config_error). The config source metrics always report the value 1, and carry the node_config_name, node_config_uid, node_config_resource_version, and node_config_kubelet_key labels, which identify the config version. The error metric reports 1 if there is an error, 0 otherwise. (#57527, @mtaufen)
* The kubelet certificate rotation feature can now be enabled via the `.RotateCertificates` field in the kubelet's config file. The `--rotate-certificates` flag is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. (#63912, @luxas)
* The dynamic Kubelet config feature will now update config in the event of a ConfigMap mutation, which reduces the chance for silent config skew. Only name, namespace, and kubeletConfigKey may now be set in Node.Spec.ConfigSource.ConfigMap. The least disruptive pattern for config management is still to create a new ConfigMap and incrementally roll out a new Node.Spec.ConfigSource. (#63221, @mtaufen)
* The NodeRestriction admission plugin now prevents kubelets from modifying/removing taints applied to their Node API object. (#63167, @liggitt)
* The status of dynamic Kubelet config is now reported via Node.Status.Config, rather than the KubeletConfigOk node condition. (#63314, @mtaufen)
* kubelet: fix hangs in updating Node status after network interruptions/changes between the kubelet and API server (#63492, @liggitt)
* The Kubelet's deprecated --allow-privileged flag now defaults to true. This enables users to stop setting --allow-privileged in order to transition to PodSecurityPolicy. Previously, users had to continue setting --allow-privileged, because the default was false. (#63442, @mtaufen)
* You must now specify Node.Spec.ConfigSource.ConfigMap.KubeletConfigKey when using dynamic Kubelet config to tell the Kubelet which key of the ConfigMap identifies its config file. (#59847, @mtaufen)

* Remove UID mutation from request.context. (#63957, @hzxuzhonghu)
* list/watch API requests with a fieldSelector that specifies `metadata.name` can now be authorized as requests for an individual named resource (#63469, @wojtek-t)
* Added support for NFS relations on kubernetes-worker charm. (#63817, @hyperbolic2346)
* Create a new `dryRun` query parameter for mutating endpoints. If the parameter is set, then the query will be rejected, as the feature is not implemented yet. This will allow forward compatibility with future clients; otherwise, future clients talking with older apiservers might end up modifying a resource even if they include the `dryRun` query parameter.
