# Kubernetes 1.11 Release Notes

This document is for release notes for Kubernetes 1.11. These release notes are initially generated from commit messages, and are sorted based on the release note tag.

Commits should be tagged as follows:

**/release-note-before-upgrading**

This tag is for urgent changes that users must take into consideration before upgrading. For example, mandatory upgrades of dependencies or other upgrade/downgrade issues belong in this category.

**/release-note-feature**

This tag is for changes that are related to major features that are listed in the feature tracking spreadsheet.

**/release-note**

This tag is for changes that are user-facing. For example, API changes or CLI flag changes belong in this category. Fixed bugs that affect the user experience should also be in this category.

**/release-note-none**

This tag is for changes that don't affect the user experience, such as behind-the-scenes improvements that only other Kubernetes developers will notice. These notes will appear in the changelog but not the release notes.
