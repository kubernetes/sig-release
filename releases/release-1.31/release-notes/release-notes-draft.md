## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Added support to the scheduler to start using QueueingHint registered for Pod/Updated event to determine whether unschedulable Pods update make them schedulable, when the feature gate `SchedulerQueueingHints` is enabled.
  Previously, when unschedulable Pods are updated, the scheduler always put Pods back to activeQ/backoffQ. But, actually not all updates to Pods make Pods schedulable, especially considering many scheduling constraints nowadays are immutable.
  Now, when unschedulable Pods are updated, the scheduling queue checks with QueueingHint(s) whether the update may make the pods schedulable, and requeues them to activeQ/backoffQ **only when** at least one QueueingHint(s) return Queue. 
  
  Action required for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  Plugins **have to** implement a QueueingHint for Pod/Update event if the rejection from them could be resolved by updating unscheduled Pods themselves.
  Example: suppose you develop a custom plugin that denies Pods that have a `schedulable=false` label. 
  Given Pods with a `schedulable=false` label will be schedulable if the `schedulable=false` label is removed, this plugin would implement QueueingHint for Pod/Update event that returns Queue when such label changes are made in unscheduled Pods. ([#122234](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122234), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
 - Kubelet flag `--keep-terminated-pod-volumes` was removed.  This flag was deprecated in 2017. ([#122082](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122082), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Apps, Node, Storage and Testing]
 - Reduce state change noise when volume expansion fails. Also mark certain failures as infeasible.
  
  If you are using the RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure alpha feature, after upgrading to this release, existing PVCs with status.allocatedResourceStatus set to "ControllerResizeFailed" or "NodeResizeFailed" should have their status.allocatedResourceStatus cleared.

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- 'kubeadm: marked the sub-phase of ''init kubelet-finilize'' called ''experimental-cert-rotation''
  as deprecated and print a warning if it is used directly; it will be removed in
  a future release. Add a replacement sub-phase ''enable-client-cert-rotation''.' ([#124419](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124419), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Added a warning when creating or updating a PV with the deprecated annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options` ([#124819](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124819), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Storage]
- CephFS volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/cephfs`) was removed in this release and the `cephfs` volume type became non-functional. Alternative is to use CephFS CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. A re-deployment of your application is required to use the new driver if you were using `kubernetes.io/cephfs` volume plugin before upgrading cluster version to 1.31+. ([#124544](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124544), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node, Scalability, Storage and Testing]
- CephRBD volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/rbd`) was removed in this release. And its csi migration support was also removed, so the `rbd` volume type became non-functional. Alternative is to use RBD CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. A re-deployment of your application is required to use the new driver if you were using `kubernetes.io/rbd` volume plugin before upgrading cluster version to 1.31+. ([#124546](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124546), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler deprecated all non-csi volumelimit plugins and removed those from defaults plugins. 
  - AzureDiskLimits
  - CinderLimits
  - EBSLimits
  - GCEPDLimits
  
  The NodeVolumeLimits plugin can handle the same functionality as the above plugins since the above volume types are migrated to CSI.
  Please remove those plugins and replace them with the NodeVolumeLimits plugin if you explicitly use those plugins in the scheduler config.
  Those plugins will be removed in the release 1.32. ([#124500](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124500), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Kubeadm: deprecated the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate (previously alpha), given that the core K8s `UserNamespacesSupport` feature gate graduated to beta in 1.30.
  Once core Kubernetes support for user namespaces is generally available and kubeadm has started to support running the control plane in userns pods, the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate will be removed entirely.
  Until kubeadm supports the userns functionality out of the box, users can continue using the deprecated  `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate, or  opt-in `UserNamespacesSupport` by using kubeadm patches on the static pod manifests. ([#124997](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124997), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Removed k8s.io/legacy-cloud-providers from staging. ([#124767](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124767), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Release]
- Removed legacy cloud provider integration code (undoing a previous reverted commit). ([#124886](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124886), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Release]

### API Change

- Add Coordinated Leader Election as alpha under the CoordinatedLeaderElection feature gate. With the feature enabled, the control plane can use LeaseCandidate objects (coordination.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group) to participate in a leader election and let the kube-apiserver select the best instance according to some strategy. ([#124012](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124012), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Cloud Provider, Etcd, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Add UserNamespaces field to NodeRuntimeHandlerFeatures ([#126034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126034), [@sohankunkerkar](https://github.com/sohankunkerkar)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- Add an AllocatedResourcesStatus to each container status to indicate the health status of devices exposed by the device plugin. ([#126243](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126243), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- Added Node.Status.Features.SupplementalGroupsPolicy field which is set to true when the feature is implemented in the CRI implementation (KEP-3619) ([#125470](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125470), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]
- Added support to the kube-proxy nodePortAddresses / --nodeport-addresses option to
  accept the value "primary", meaning to only listen for NodePort connections
  on the node's primary IPv4 and/or IPv6 address (according to the Node object).
  This is strongly recommended, if you were not previously using
  --nodeport-addresses, to avoid surprising behavior.
  (This behavior is enabled by default with the nftables backend; you would
  need to explicitly request `--nodeport-addresses 0.0.0.0/0,::/0` there to get
  the traditional "listen on all interfaces" behavior.) ([#123105](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123105), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Network and Windows]
- Added the feature gates `StrictCostEnforcementForVAP` and `StrictCostEnforcementForWebhooks` to enforce the strict cost calculation for CEL extended libraries. It is strongly recommended to turn on the feature gates as early as possible. ([#124675](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124675), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Changed how the API server handles updates to `.spec.defaultBackend` of Ingress objects.
  Server-side apply now considers `.spec.defaultBackend` to be an atomic struct.  This means that any field-owner who sets values in that struct (they are mutually exclusive) owns the whole struct. For almost all users this change has no impact; for controllers that want to change the default backend port from number to name (or vice-versa), this makes it easier. ([#126207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126207), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Component-base/logs: when compiled with Go >= 1.21, component-base will automatically configure the slog default logger together with initializing klog. ([#120696](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120696), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Storage and Testing]
- CustomResourceDefinition objects created with non-empty `caBundle` fields which are invalid or do not contain any certificates will not appear in discovery or serve endpoints until a valid `caBundle` is provided. Updates to CustomResourceDefinition are no longer allowed to transition a valid `caBundle` field to an invalid `caBundle` field, because this breaks serving of the existing CustomResourceDefinition. ([#124061](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124061), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery]
- DRA: The DRA driver's daemonset must be deployed with a service account that enables writing ResourceSlice and reading ResourceClaim objects. ([#125163](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125163), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Auth, Node and Testing]
- DRA: new API and several new features ([#125488](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125488), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Etcd, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- DRA: the number of ResourceClaim objects can be limited per namespace and by the number of devices requested through a specific class via the v1.ResourceQuota mechanism. ([#120611](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120611), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Etcd, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]
- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): client-side validation of a ResourceHandle would have accepted a missing DriverName, whereas server-side validation then would have raised an error. ([#124075](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124075), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): in the `pod.spec.recourceClaims` array, the `source` indirection is no longer necessary. Instead of e.g. `source: resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`, one can write `resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`. ([#125116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125116), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Fix the documentation for the default value of the procMount entry in the pod securityContext.
  The documentation was previously using the name of the internal variable 'DefaultProcMount' rather than the actual value 'Default'. ([#125782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125782), [@aborrero](https://github.com/aborrero)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Fixed a 1.30.0 regression in OpenAPI descriptions of the `imagePullSecrets` and 
  `hostAliases` fields to mark the fields used as keys in those lists as either defaulted
  or required. ([#124553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124553), [@pmalek](https://github.com/pmalek))
- Fixed a 1.30.0 regression in openapi descriptions of `PodIP.IP`  and `HostIP.IP` fields to mark the fields used as keys in those lists as required. ([#126057](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126057), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Fixed a bug in the API server where empty collections of ValidatingAdmissionPolicies did not have an `items` field. ([#124568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124568), [@xyz-li](https://github.com/xyz-li)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixed a deep copy issue when retrieving the controller reference. ([#124116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124116), [@HiranmoyChowdhury](https://github.com/HiranmoyChowdhury)) [SIG API Machinery and Release]
- Fixed code-generator client-gen to work with `api/v1`-like package structure. ([#125162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125162), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Fixed incorrect "v1 Binding is deprecated in v1.6+" warning in kube-scheduler log. ([#125540](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125540), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Fixed the comment for the Job's managedBy field. ([#124793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124793), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Graduate PodDisruptionConditions to GA and lock ([#125461](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125461), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduate the Job SuccessPolicy to Beta.
  
  The new reason label, "SuccessPolicy" and "CompletionsReached" are added to the "jobs_finished_total" metric.
  Additionally, If we enable the "JobSuccessPolicy" feature gate, the Job gets "CompletionsReached" reason for the "SuccessCriteriaMet" and "Complete" condition type
  when the number of succeeded Job Pods (".status.succeeded") reached the desired completions (".spec.completions"). ([#126067](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126067), [@tenzen-y](https://github.com/tenzen-y)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Graduated MatchLabelKeys/MismatchLabelKeys feature in PodAffinity/PodAntiAffinity to Beta. ([#123638](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123638), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated `JobPodFailurePolicy` to GA and locked it to it's default. ([#125442](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125442), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to beta. By default, the kubelet no longer attempts to set the `.status.kubeProxyVersion` field for its associated Node. ([#123845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123845), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Network, Node and Testing]
- Improved scheduling performance when many nodes, and prefilter returned 1-2 nodes (e.g. daemonset)
  
  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, note that the semantics of NodeToStatusMap are changing: A node with an absent value in the NodeToStatusMap should be interpreted as having an UnschedulableAndUnresolvable status. ([#125197](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125197), [@gabesaba](https://github.com/gabesaba))
- Introduce a new boolean kubelet flag --fail-cgroupv1 ([#126031](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126031), [@harche](https://github.com/harche)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- K8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime: Added support for new calls to handle panics and errors in the context where they occur. `PanicHandlers` and `ErrorHandlers` now must accept a context parameter for that. Log output is structured instead of unstructured. ([#121970](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121970), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- KEP-1880: Users of the new feature to add multiple service CIDR will use by default a dual-write strategy on the new ClusterIP allocators to avoid the problem of possible duplicate IPs allocated to Services when running skewed kube-apiservers using different allocators. They can opt-out of this behavior by enabled the feature gate DisableAllocatorDualWrite. ([#122047](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122047), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: Added alpha features to allow API server authz to check the context of requests:
  - The `AuthorizeWithSelectors` feature gate enables including field and label selector information from requests in webhook authorization calls.
  - The `AuthorizeNodeWithSelectors` feature gate changes node authorizer behavior to limit requests from node API clients, so that each Node can only get / list / watch its own Node API object, and can also only get / list / watch Pod API objects bound to that node. Clients using kubelet credentials to read other nodes or unrelated pods must change their authentication credentials (recommended), adjust their usage, or obtain broader read access independent of the node authorizer. ([#125571](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125571), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: ControllerRevision objects are now verified to contain valid JSON data in the `data` field. ([#125549](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125549), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Kube-apiserver: the `--encryption-provider-config` file is now loaded with strict deserialization, which fails if the config file contains duplicate or unknown fields. This protects against accidentally running with config files that are malformed, mis-indented, or have typos in field names, and getting unexpected behavior. When `--encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload` is used, new encryption config files that contain typos after the kube-apiserver is running are treated as invalid and the last valid config is used. ([#124912](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124912), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kube-controller-manager: the `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-upscale-delay` and `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-delay` flags have been removed (deprecated and non-functional since v1.12). ([#124948](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124948), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Autoscaling]
- Kube-proxy Windows service control manager integration(--windows-service) is now configurable in v1alpha1 component configuration via `WindowsRunAsService` field ([#126072](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126072), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman)) [SIG Network and Scalability]
- PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime feature is stable and enabled by default. ([#124969](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124969), [@RomanBednar](https://github.com/RomanBednar)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Storage and Testing]
- Promote LocalStorageCapacityIsolation to beta and enable if user namespace is enabled for the pod ([#126014](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126014), [@PannagaRao](https://github.com/PannagaRao)) [SIG Apps, Autoscaling, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Promote StatefulSetStartOrdinal to stable. This means `--feature-gates=StatefulSetStartOrdinal=true` are not needed on kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager binaries and they'll be removed soon following policy at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/#deprecation ([#125374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125374), [@pwschuurman](https://github.com/pwschuurman)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Promoted feature-gate `VolumeAttributesClass` to beta (disabled by default). Users need to enable the feature gate and the storage v1beta1 group to use this new feature.
  - Promoted API `VolumeAttributesClass` and `VolumeAttributesClassList` to `storage.k8s.io/v1beta1`. ([#126145](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126145), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Etcd, Storage and Testing]
- Removed deprecated command flags --volume-host-cidr-denylist
  and --volume-host-allow-local-loopback from kube-controller-manager.
   ([#124017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124017), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Cloud Provider and Storage]
- Removed feature gate `CustomResourceValidationExpressions`. ([#126136](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126136), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Testing]
- Revert "Move ConsistentListFromCache feature flag to Beta and enable it by default" ([#126139](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126139), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Revised the Pod API with alpha support for volumes derived from OCI artefacts.
  This feature is behind the `ImageVolume` feature gate. ([#125660](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125660), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- Supported fine-grained supplemental groups policy (KEP-3619), which enabled
  fine-grained control for supplementary groups in the first container processes.
  This allows you to choose whether to include groups defined in the container image (/etc/groups)
  for the container's primary UID or not. ([#117842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117842), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The (alpha) nftables mode of kube-proxy now requires version 1.0.1 or later
  of the nft command-line, and kernel 5.13 or later. (For testing/development
  purposes, you can use older kernels, as far back as 5.4, if you set the
  `nftables.skipKernelVersionCheck` option in the kube-proxy config, but this is not
  recommended in production since it may cause problems with other nftables
  users on the system.) ([#124152](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124152), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]
- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions for existing expressions in storage, will fully support runtime in next release for compatibility concern. ([#126188](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126188), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Updated the feature MultiCIDRServiceAllocator to beta (disabled by default). Users need to enable the feature gate and the networking v1beta1 group to be able to use this new feature, that allows to dynamically reconfigure Service CIDR ranges. ([#125021](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125021), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network and Testing]
- Use omitempty for optional Job Pod Failure Policy fields. ([#126046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126046), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo))
- User can choose a different static policy option `SpreadPhysicalCPUsPreferredOption` to spread cpus across physical cpus for some specific applications ([#123733](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123733), [@Jeffwan](https://github.com/Jeffwan)) [SIG Node]
- When the featuregate AnonymousAuthConfigurableEndpoints is enabled users can update the AuthenticationConfig file with endpoints for with anonymous requests are alllowed.

### Feature

- 'kubeadm: enhanced the "patches" functionality to be able to patch coredns
  deployment. The new patch target is called "corednsdeployment" (e.g. patch file
  "corednsdeployment+json.json"). This makes it possible to apply custom patches

- If the feature-gate VolumeAttributesClass is enabled, when finding a suitable persistent volume for a claim, the kube-controller-manager will be aware of the `volumeAttributesClassName` field of PVC and PV objects. The `volumeAttributesClassName` field is a reference to a VolumeAttributesClass object, which contains a set of key-value pairs that present mutable attributes of the volume. It's forbidden to change the `volumeAttributesClassName` field of a PVC object until the PVC is bound to a PV object. During the binding process, if a PVC has a `volumeAttributesClassName` field set, the controller will only consider volumes that have the same `volumeAttributesClassName` as the PVC. If the `volumeAttributesClassName` field is not set or set to an empty string, only volumes with empty `volumeAttributesClassName` will be considered.

([#124688](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124688), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: Switched kubeadm to start using the CRI client library instead of shelling out of the `crictl` binary
  for actions against a CRI endpoint. The kubeadm deb/rpm packages will continue to install the `cri-tools`
  package for one more release, but in you must adapt your scripts to install `crictl` manually from
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases or a different location.
  
  The `kubeadm` package will stop depending on the `cri-tools` package in Kubernetes 1.32, which means that
  installing `kubeadm` will no longer automatically ensure installation of `crictl`. ([#124685](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124685), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))

It can be used to tell kubeadm to use the local kube-apiserver endpoint for the kubelet when creating a cluster with "kubeadm init" or when joining control plane nodes with "kubeadm join".  The "kubeadm join" workflow now includes two new experimental phases called "control-plane-join-etcd" and "kubelet-wait-bootstrap" which will be used when the feature gate is enabled. This phases will be marked as non-experimental when ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode becomes GA. During "kubeadm upgrade" commands, if the feature gate is enabled, modify the "/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf " to use the local kube-apiserver endpoint. This upgrade mechanism will be removed once the feature gate goes GA and is hardcoded to true.

- Kubeadm: enabled the v1beta4 API. For a complete changelog since v1beta3 please see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/. 
  
  The API does include a few breaking changes:
  - The "extraArgs" component construct is now a list of "name"/"value" pairs instead of a string/string map. This has been done to support duplicate args where needed.
  - The "JoinConfiguration.discovery.timeout" field has been replaced by "JoinConfiguration.timeouts.discovery".
  - The "ClusterConfiguration.timeoutForControlPlane" field has been replaced by "{Init|Join}Configuration.timeouts.controlPlaneComponentHealthCheck".
  Please use the command "kubeadm config migrate" to migrate your existing v1beta3 configuration to v1beta4.
  
  v1beta3 is now marked as deprecated but will continue to be supported until version 1.34 or later.

  does not have tracing. It makes use of the `WithPublicEndpoint` option to prevent callers
  from influencing sampling decisions. ([#121770](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121770), [@frzifus](https://github.com/frzifus))
- Updated the CEL default compatibility environment version to 1.30, ensuring that extended libraries added before version 1.30 are available for use. ([#124779](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124779), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37))
- Users can traverse all the pods that are in the scheduler and waiting in the permit stage through method `IterateOverWaitingPods`. In other words,  all waitingPods in scheduler can be obtained from any profiles. Before this commit, each profile could only obtain waitingPods within that profile.

  using kubectl create cronjobs to ensure backward compatibility. ([#124883](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124883), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): using structured parameters with a claim that gets reused between pods may have led to a claim with an invalid state (allocated without a finalizer) which then caused scheduling of pods using the claim to stop. ([#124931](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124931), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node and Scheduling]
- Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA): Enhanced validation for the ResourceClaimParametersReference and ResourceClassParametersReference with the following rules:
  
  1. `apiGroup`: If set, it must be a valid DNS subdomain (e.g. 'example.com').
  2. `kind` and `name`: It must be valid path segment name. It may not be '.' or '..' and it may not contain '/' and '%' characters. ([#125218](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125218), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory))

- Fixed a bug that Pods could stuck in the unschedulable pod pool 
  if they're rejected by PreEnqueue plugins that could change its result by a change in resources apart from Pods.
  
  DRA plugin is the only plugin that meets the criteria of the bug in in-tree, 
  and hence if you have `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature flag enabled,

- Kubeadm: Removed support for mounting /etc/pki as an additional Linux system CA location
  in kube-apisever and kube-controller-manager pods. Instead, it shifted to supporting the
  mounting of /etc/pki/ca-trust and /etc/pki/tls/certs. The locations /etc/ca-certificate,
  /usr/share/ca-certificates, /usr/local/share/ca-certificates, and /etc/ssl/certs continued
  to be supported. ([#124361](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124361), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: The healthz address:port configured in the KubeletConfiguration was used during kubelet health checks, instead of hardcoding localhost:10248. ([#125265](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125265), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: during the validation of existing kubeconfig files on disk, handle cases where the "ca.crt" is a bundle and has intermediate certificates. Find a common trust anchor between the "ca.crt" bundle and the CA in the existing kubeconfig on disk instead of treating "ca.crt" as a file containing a single CA.

([#125779](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125779), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: the `--feature-gates` flag is deprecated and no-op for `kubeadm upgrade apply/plan`, and it will be removed in a future release.

- The "fake" clients generated by `client-gen` now have the same semantics on
  error as the real clients; in particular, a failed Get(), Create(), etc, no longer
  returns `nil`. (It now returns a pointer to a zero-valued object, like the real
  clients do.) This will break some downstream unit tests that were testing
  `result == nil` rather than `err != nil`, and in some cases may expose bugs
  in the underlying code that were hidden by the incorrect unit tests. ([#122892](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122892), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation and Storage]

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- "Removed the ability to run `kubectl exec [POD] [COMMAND]` without a `--` separator.
  The `--` separator has been recommended since the Kubernetes v1.18 release, which also deprecated the legacy way of invoking `kubectl exec`.
  
  This change aligns with the deprecation of legacy `kubectl exec` command execution and enforces the use of `kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND]` for improved compatibility and adherence to recommended practices."
