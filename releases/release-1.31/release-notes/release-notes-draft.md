## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kubelet flag `--keep-terminated-pod-volumes` was removed.  This flag was deprecated in 2017. ([#122082](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122082), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Apps, Node, Storage and Testing]
 - The scheduler starts to use QueueingHint registered for Pod/Updated event to determine whether unschedulable Pods update make them schedulable, when the feature gate `SchedulerQueueingHints` is enabled.
  Previously, when unschedulable Pods are updated, the scheduler always put Pods back to activeQ/backoffQ. But, actually not all updates to Pods make Pods schedulable, especially considering many scheduling constraints nowadays are immutable.
  Now, when unschedulable Pods are updated, the scheduling queue checks with QueueingHint(s) whether the update may make the pods schedulable, and requeues them to activeQ/backoffQ **only when** at least one QueueingHint(s) return Queue. 
  
  Action required for custom scheduler plugin developers:
  Plugins **have to** implement a QueueingHint for Pod/Update event if the rejection from them could be resolved by updating unscheduled Pods themselves.
  Example: suppose you develop a custom plugin that denies Pods that have a `schedulable=false` label. 
  Given Pods with a `schedulable=false` label will be schedulable if the `schedulable=false` label is removed, this plugin would implement QueueingHint for Pod/Update event that returns Queue when such label changes are made in unscheduled Pods.

## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- CephFS volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/cephfs`) was removed in this release and the `cephfs` volume type became non-functional. Alternative is to use CephFS CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. A re-deployment of your application is required to use the new driver if you were using `kubernetes.io/cephfs` volume plugin before upgrading cluster version to 1.31+. ([#124544](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124544), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node, Scalability, Storage and Testing]
- CephRBD volume plugin ( `kubernetes.io/rbd`) was removed in this release. And its csi migration support was also removed, so the `rbd` volume type became non-functional. Alternative is to use RBD CSI driver (https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/) in your Kubernetes Cluster. A re-deployment of your application is required to use the new driver if you were using `kubernetes.io/rbd` volume plugin before upgrading cluster version to 1.31+. ([#124546](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124546), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Node, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler deprecated all non-csi volumelimit plugins and removed those from defaults plugins. 
  - AzureDiskLimits
  - CinderLimits
  - EBSLimits
  - GCEPDLimits
  
  The NodeVolumeLimits plugin can handle the same functionality as the above plugins since the above volume types are migrated to CSI.
  Please remove those plugins and replace them with the NodeVolumeLimits plugin if you explicitly use those plugins in the scheduler config.
  Those plugins will be removed in the release 1.32. ([#124500](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124500), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Kubeadm: deprecated the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate (previously alpha), given that the core K8s `UserNamespacesSupport` feature gate graduated to Beta in 1.30.
  Once core Kubernetes support for user namespaces is generally available and kubeadm has started to support running the control plane in userns pods, the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate will be removed entirely.
  Until kubeadm supports the userns functionality out of the box, users can continue using the deprecated  `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate, or  opt-in `UserNamespacesSupport` by using kubeadm patches on the static pod manifests. ([#124997](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124997), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: mark the sub-phase of 'init kubelet-finilize' called 'experimental-cert-rotation' as deprecated and print a warning if it is used directly; it will be removed in a future release. Add a replacement sub-phase 'enable-client-cert-rotation'. ([#124419](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124419), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Remove k8s.io/legacy-cloud-providers from staging ([#124767](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124767), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Release]
- Removed legacy cloud provider integration code (undoing a previous reverted commit) ([#124886](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124886), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Release]

### API Change

- Added the feature gates `StrictCostEnforcementForVAP` and `StrictCostEnforcementForWebhooks` to enforce the strct cost calculation for CEL extended libraries. It is strongly recommended to turn on the feature gates as early as possible. ([#124675](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124675), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]
- Component-base/logs: when compiled with Go >= 1.21, component-base will automatically configure the slog default logger together with initializing klog. ([#120696](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120696), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Storage and Testing]
- DRA: client-side validation of a ResourceHandle would have accepted a missing DriverName, whereas server-side validation then would have raised an error. ([#124075](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124075), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Apps]
- DRA: in the `pod.spec.recourceClaims` array, the `source` indirection is no longer necessary. Instead of e.g. `source: resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`, one can write `resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`. ([#125116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125116), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Fix Deep Copy issue in getting controller reference ([#124116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124116), [@HiranmoyChowdhury](https://github.com/HiranmoyChowdhury)) [SIG API Machinery and Release]
- Fix code-generator client-gen to work with `api/v1`-like package structure. ([#125162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125162), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Fix the comment for the Job's managedBy field ([#124793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124793), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Fixed incorrect "v1 Binding is deprecated in v1.6+" warning in kube-scheduler log. ([#125540](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125540), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixes a 1.30.0 regression in openapi descriptions of imagePullSecrets and hostAliases fields to mark the fields used as keys in those lists as either defaulted or required. ([#124553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124553), [@pmalek](https://github.com/pmalek)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Graduate MatchLabelKeys/MismatchLabelKeys feature in PodAffinity/PodAntiAffinity to Beta ([#123638](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123638), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]
- Graduated the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to beta. By default, the kubelet no longer attempts to set the `.status.kubeProxyVersion` field for its associated Node. ([#123845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123845), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Network, Node and Testing]
- Improved scheduling performance when many nodes, and prefilter returns 1-2 nodes (e.g. daemonset)
  
  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, note that the semantics of NodeToStatusMap are changing: A node with an absent value in the NodeToStatusMap should be interpreted as having an UnschedulableAndUnresolvable status ([#125197](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125197), [@gabesaba](https://github.com/gabesaba)) [SIG Scheduling]
- K8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime: new calls support handling panics and errors in the context where they occur. `PanicHandlers` and `ErrorHandlers` now must accept a context parameter for that. Log output is structured instead of unstructured. ([#121970](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121970), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]
- KEP-1880: Users of the new feature to add multiple service CIDR will use by default a dual-write strategy on the new ClusterIP allocators to avoid the problem of possible duplicate IPs allocated to Services when running skewed kube-apiservers using different allocators. They can opt-out of this behavior by enabled the feature gate DisableAllocatorDualWrite ([#122047](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122047), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Kube-apiserver: ControllerRevision objects are now verified to contain valid JSON data in the `data` field. ([#125549](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125549), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]
- Kube-apiserver: the `--encryption-provider-config` file is now loaded with strict deserialization, which fails if the config file contains duplicate or unknown fields. This protects against accidentally running with config files that are malformed, mis-indented, or have typos in field names, and getting unexpected behavior. When `--encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload` is used, new encryption config files that contain typos after the kube-apiserver is running are treated as invalid and the last valid config is used. ([#124912](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124912), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kube-controller-manager removes deprecated command flags: --volume-host-cidr-denylist and --volume-host-allow-local-loopback ([#124017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124017), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Cloud Provider and Storage]
- Kube-controller-manager: the `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-upscale-delay` and `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-delay` flags have been removed (deprecated and non-functional since v1.12) ([#124948](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124948), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Autoscaling]
- Support fine-grained supplemental groups policy (KEP-3619), which enables fine-grained control for supplementary groups in the first container processes. You can choose whether to include groups defined in the container image(/etc/groups) for the container's primary uid or not. ([#117842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117842), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]
- The kube-proxy nodeportAddresses / --nodeport-addresses option now
  accepts the value "primary", meaning to only listen for NodePort connections
  on the node's primary IPv4 and/or IPv6 address (according to the Node object).
  This is strongly recommended, if you were not previously using
  --nodeport-addresses, to avoid surprising behavior.
  
  (This behavior is enabled by default with the nftables backend; you would
  need to explicitly request `--nodeport-addresses 0.0.0.0/0,::/0` there to get
  the traditional "listen on all interfaces" behavior.) ([#123105](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123105), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Network and Windows]
- Update the feature MultiCIDRServiceAllocator to beta (disabled by default). Users need to enable the feature gate and the networking v1beta1 group to be able to use this new feature, that allows to dynamically reconfigure Service CIDR ranges. ([#125021](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125021), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network and Testing]
- When the featuregate AnonymousAuthConfigurableEndpoints is enabled users can update the AuthenticationConfig file with endpoints for with anonymous requests are alllowed. ([#124917](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124917), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider, Node and Testing]

  Use `fake.NewClientset()` instead of `fake.NewSimpleClientset()` to create a clientset with managed field support. ([#125560](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125560), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Instrumentation and Testing]
- Add the` WatchList` method to the `rest client` in `client-go`. When used, it establishes a stream to obtain a consistent snapshot of data from the server. This method is meant to be used by the generated client. ([#122657](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122657), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added `cri-client` staging repository. ([#123797](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123797), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG API Machinery, Node, Release and Testing]

- Added ports autocompletion for kubectl port-foward command ([#124683](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124683), [@TessaIO](https://github.com/TessaIO)) [SIG CLI]
- Added support for building Windows kube-proxy container image.
  A container image for kube-proxy on Windows can now be built with the command
  `make release-images KUBE_BUILD_WINDOWS=y`.
  The Windows kube-proxy image can be used with Windows Host Process Containers. ([#109939](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109939), [@claudiubelu](https://github.com/claudiubelu)) [SIG Windows]
- Adds completion for `kubectl set image`. ([#124592](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124592), [@ah8ad3](https://github.com/ah8ad3)) [SIG CLI]
- Allow creating ServiceAccount tokens bound to Node objects.
  This allows users to bind a service account token's validity to a named Node object, similar to Pod bound tokens.
  Use with `kubectl create token <serviceaccount-name> --bound-object-kind=Node --bound-object-node=<node-name>`. ([#125238](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125238), [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz)) [SIG Auth and CLI]
- CEL default compatibility environment version to updated to 1.30 so that the extended libraries added before 1.30 is available to use. ([#124779](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124779), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery]
- CEL expressions and `additionalProperties` are now allowed to be used under nested quantifiers in CRD schemas ([#124381](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124381), [@alexzielenski](https://github.com/alexzielenski)) [SIG API Machinery]
- CEL: add name formats library ([#123572](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123572), [@alexzielenski](https://github.com/alexzielenski)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Checking etcd version to warn about deprecated etcd versions if `ConsistentListFromCache` is enabled. ([#124612](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124612), [@ah8ad3](https://github.com/ah8ad3)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Client-go/reflector: warns when the bookmark event for initial events hasn't been received ([#124614](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124614), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Continue streaming kubelet logs when the CRI server of the runtime is unavailable. ([#124025](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124025), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG Node]
- Custom resource field selectors are now in beta and enabled by default. Check out https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4358 for more details. ([#124681](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124681), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Dependencies: start using registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10 ([#125112](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125112), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Node, Release, Testing and Windows]
- Feature gates for PortForward (kubectl port-forward) over WebSockets are now enabled by default (Beta).
  - Server-side feature gate: PortForwardWebsocket
  - Client-side (kubectl) feature gate: PORT_FORWARD_WEBSOCKETS environment variable
  - To turn off PortForward over WebSockets for kubectl, the environment variable feature gate must be explicitly set - PORT_FORWARD_WEBSOCKETS=false ([#125528](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125528), [@seans3](https://github.com/seans3)) [SIG API Machinery and CLI]
- Graduated support for CDI device IDs to general availability. The `DevicePluginCDIDevices` feature gate is now enabled unconditionally. ([#123315](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123315), [@bart0sh](https://github.com/bart0sh)) [SIG Node]
- Graduates the `WatchList` feature gate to Beta for kube-apiserver and enables `WatchListClient` for KCM. ([#125591](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125591), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]
- Improve memory usage of kube-apiserver by dropping the `.metadata.managedFields` field that self-requested informers of kube-apiserver doesn't need. ([#124667](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124667), [@linxiulei](https://github.com/linxiulei)) [SIG API Machinery]
- In the client-side apply on create, defining the null value as "delete the key associated with this value". ([#125646](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125646), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI and Testing]
- Introduces new functionality to the client-go's `List` method, allowing users to enable API streaming. To activate this feature, users can set the `client-go.WatchListClient` feature gate.
  
  It is important to note that the server must support streaming for this feature to function properly. If streaming is not supported by the server, client-go will revert to using the normal `LIST` method to obtain data. ([#124509](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124509), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Instrumentation and Testing]
- KEP-3857: promote RecursiveReadOnlyMounts feature to beta ([#125475](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125475), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-apiserver: http/2 serving can be disabled with a `--disable-http2-serving` flag ([#122176](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122176), [@slashpai](https://github.com/slashpai)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Kube-proxy's nftables mode (--proxy-mode=nftables) is now beta and available by default.
  
  FIXME ADD MORE HERE BEFORE THE RELEASE, DOCS LINKS AND STUFF ([#124383](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124383), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Network]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the CSILimit plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to retry scheduling a Pod that was previously rejected by the CSILimit plugin if a deleted pod has a PVC from the same driver. ([#121508](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121508), [@utam0k](https://github.com/utam0k)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the InterPodAffinity plugin.
  The scheduling hints allow the scheduler to retry scheduling a Pod
  that was previously rejected by the InterPodAffinity plugin if create/delete/update a related Pod or a node which matches the pod affinity. ([#122471](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122471), [@nayihz](https://github.com/nayihz)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Kube-scheduler implements scheduling hints for the VolumeRestriction plugin.
  Scheduling hints allow the scheduler to retry scheduling Pods that were previously rejected by the VolumeRestriction plugin if the Pod is deleted and the deleted Pod conflicts with the existing volumes of the current Pod. ([#125279](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125279), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Scheduling and Storage]
- Kubeadm: added the ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode feature gate. It can be used to tell kubeadm to use the local kube-apiserver endpoint for the kubelet when creating a cluster with "kubeadm init" or when joining control plane nodes with "kubeadm join".  The "kubeadm join" workflow now includes two new experimental phases called "control-plane-join-etcd" and "kubelet-wait-bootstrap" which will be used when the feature gate is enabled. This phases will be marked as non-experimental when ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode becomes GA. During "kubeadm upgrade" commands, if the feature gate is enabled, modify the "/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf " to use the local kube-apiserver endpoint. This upgrade mechanism will be removed once the feature gate goes GA and is hardcoded to true. ([#125582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125582), [@chrischdi](https://github.com/chrischdi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: during "upgrade" , if the "etcd.yaml" static pod does not need upgrade, still consider rotating the etcd certificates and restarting the etcd static pod if the "kube-apiserver.yaml" manifest is to be upgraded and if certificate renewal is not disabled. ([#124688](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124688), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: enabled the v1beta4 API. For a complete changelog since v1beta3 please see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/. 
  
  The API does include a few breaking changes:
  - The "extraArgs" component construct is now a list of "name"/"value" pairs instead of a string/string map. This has been done to support duplicate args where needed.
  - The "JoinConfiguration.discovery.timeout" field has been replaced by "JoinConfiguration.timeouts.discovery".
  - The "ClusterConfiguration.timeoutForControlPlane" field has been replaced by "{Init|Join}Configuration.timeouts.controlPlaneComponentHealthCheck".
  Please use the command "kubeadm config migrate" to migrate your existing v1beta3 configuration to v1beta4.
  
  v1beta3 is now marked as deprecated but will continue to be supported until version 1.34 or later.
  The storage configuration in the kube-system/kubeadm-config ConfigMap is now a v1beta4 ClusterConfiguration. ([#125029](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125029), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: enhance the "patches" functionality to be able to patch coredns deployment. The new patch target is called "corednsdeployment" (e.g. patch file "corednsdeployment+json.json"). This makes it possible to apply custom patches to coredns deployment during "init" and "upgrade". ([#124820](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124820), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: mark the flag "--experimental-output' as deprecated (it will be removed in a future release) and add a new flag '--output" that serves the same purpose. Affected commands are - "kubeadm config images list", "kubeadm token list", "kubeadm upgade plan", "kubeadm certs check-expiration". ([#124393](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124393), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: switch to using the new etcd endpoints introduced in 3.5.11 - /livez (for liveness probe) and /readyz (for readyness and startup probe). With this change it is no longer possible to deploy a custom etcd version older than 3.5.11 with kubeadm 1.31. If so, please upgrade. ([#124465](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124465), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: switched kubeadm to start using the CRI client library instead of shelling out of the `crictl` binary
  for actions against a CRI endpoint. The kubeadm deb/rpm packages will continue to install the `cri-tools`
  package for one more release, but in you must adapt your scripts to install `crictl` manually from
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases or a different location.
  
  The `kubeadm` package will stop depending on the `cri-tools` package in Kubernetes 1.32, which means that
  installing `kubeadm` will no longer automatically ensure installation of `crictl`. ([#124685](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124685), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: use output/v1alpha3 to print structural output for the commands "kubeadm config images list" and "kubeadm token list". ([#124464](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124464), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubelet server can now dynamically load certificate files ([#124574](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124574), [@zhangweikop](https://github.com/zhangweikop)) [SIG Auth and Node]
- Kubelet will not restart the container when fields other than image in the pod spec change. ([#124220](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124220), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Node]
