Care was taken to format panics as similar as possible to the original output.\r\n\r\nFor errors, a message string gets added. There was none before, which made it impossible to find all error output coming from HandleError.\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nKeeping HandleError and HandleCrash around without deprecating while changing the signature of callbacks is a compromise between not breaking existing code and not adding too many special cases that need to be supported. There is some code which uses PanicHandlers or ErrorHandlers, but less than code that uses the Handle* calls.\r\n\r\nIn Kubernetes, we want to replace the calls. logcheck v0.8.0 warns about them in code which is supposed to be ontextual. The steps towards that are:\r\n\r\n  - add TODO remarks as reminder (this commit)\r\n  - update logcheck: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122436\r\n  - locally enable the check, merge fixes for linter warnings (e.g. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121989)\r\n  - once there are none, remove the TODO to enable the check\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nk8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime: new calls support handling panics and errors in the context where they occur. `PanicHandlers` and `ErrorHandlers` now must accept a context parameter for that.

But, actually `getUnschedulablePodsWithMatchingAffinityTerm` pre-filters Pods to receive those events based on Pods' affinity and `pod.Status.Resize`. - meaning only PodAffinity/NodeResourceFit receive them actually.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is similar to #110175 - in in-tree plugins, PodAffinity, PodTopologySpread and NodeResourceFit subscribe Pod add and/or update events. And, Pods rejected by PodTopologySpread will never be requeued to activeQ by Pod-related events. The same happens for custom plugins registering pod add and/or update events.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this problem by -\r\n\r\n- take PodTopologySpread into consideration when requeueing Pods based on Pod related events.\r\n  - This fix is mostly for people who don't use QHint enabled.\r\n- use MoveAllToActiveOrBackoffQueue only, when the feature gate is enabled.\r\n  - It's the general fix to fix the same problem in custom plugins. We have to guard it with feature flag, otherwise negative impact on the throughput.

Change the functions in `cmd/kube-proxy` to use `context.Context` not `klog.Logger` as input parameters as @danwinship suggested in \r\n\r\n\u003e Thinking about the eventual migration of `pkg/proxy` to contextual, in `pkg/proxy/nftables` at least, we are using `context.TODO()`, which ought to be fixed at some point to get a proper `context.Context` from the top level (ie, here). I'm not sure if that has any implications for the right way to migrate these files now...\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @danwinship in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122197#pullrequestreview-1767390324_\r\n\r\n2. Remove the `logger` instance in struct `ProxyServer`, since the \"add logger to instance\" is often not good option as @pholy said \r\n\r\n\u003e We had various cases like this in other components. It's always a decision between \"add logger\" / \"add context\" / \"add logger to instance\" - but that last option is often not good because the caller might have a logger with additional key/value pairs that then get ignored when calling a method which uses some other logger that was stored previously.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @pohly in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122197#discussion_r1431460812_\r\n\r\n3. We add a top logger object as subfield for each implementation of `proxy.Provider`, for example the `logger` field in struct `iptables.Proxier`, the reason is that each `proxy.Provider` will be called as a informer event handler in `ProxyServer`, there is not a good place to add logger from outside. And there are also some key/values can only be got inside the library of proxy.Provider, for example ipFamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\r\nRelated https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3077\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nMigrated the pkg/proxy to use [contextual logging](https://k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#contextual-logging).\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\n\r\n```docs\r\n- [KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging\r\n```"

When kubeadm runs in external CA mode, kubeadm runs validation logic that compares the entire existing ca certificate file (` /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt`) to the newly rendered 'dummy' kubeconfig that only reads in the first certificate from `ca.crt`. The bytes are then compared \u0026 fails the check since they are different -- 1 contains 1+N certificates, the other only contains 1 certificate.\r\n\r\nThe `ca.crt` used within validation is read here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/pkiutil/pki_helpers.go#L292\r\n\r\nThe original `ca.crt` is read here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.go#L257\r\n\r\nThe check is happening here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kubeadm/app/phases/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.go#L268\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nFixes kubernetes/kubeadm#3011\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```YES```\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\nkubeadm: during the validation of existing kubeconfig files on disk, handle cases where the \"ca.crt\" is a bundle and has intermediate certificates.

But if we want it to be _optional_ for the other backends, it turns out to be easier to just implement it by just passing an appropriate `nodePortAddresses []string` to the constructor instead.\r\n\r\nThe first commit (\"Remove an unused type...\") was something I noticed while implementing this in a different way that I then changed my mind about, so it ends up being pretty much irrelevant to this PR, but :man_shrugging: \r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nThe kube-proxy nodeportAddresses / --nodeport-addresses option now\r\naccepts the value \"primary\", meaning to only listen for NodePort connections\r\non the node's primary IPv4 and/or IPv6 address (according to the Node object).\r\nThis is strongly recommended, if you were not previously using\r\n--nodeport-addresses, to avoid surprising behavior.\r\n\r\n(This behavior is enabled by default with the nftables backend; you would\r\nneed to explicitly request `--nodeport-addresses 0.0.0.0/0,::/0` there to get\r\nthe traditional \"listen on all interfaces\" behavior.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n/kind bug\r\n/kind cleanup\r\n/sig network\r\n/priority important-longterm\r\ncc @nayihz \r\n"

If the underlying array is modified between calls to Read, corrupt frame data could be returned.\r\n\r\nThis is also called out in the io.Reader contract: \"Implementations must not retain p.\"\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThe current usage in `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/streaming` does not appear to be affected. Even though it passes the frame reader slices with cap \u003e len, it always either creates a new slice or ignores the slice contents on io.ErrShortBuffer.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

Passing in an existing path of `status` fixes the issue and reverts back to the original behaviour.\r\n\r\nCC @sttts @deads2k\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

I don't mind which of these is merged, we just really need this fix.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nFixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/115819\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\nThere's a lot of discussion in the original PR around making additional changes to address force-deletes: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119570\r\nI am of the same mind as the original author that this PR should remain scoped down to this eviction problem\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nFixes a bug where hard evictions due to resource pressure would let the pod have the full termination grace period, instead of shutting down instantly. This bug also affected force deleted pods. Both cases now get a termination grace period of 1 second.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional documentation e.g., KEPs (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals), usage docs, etc.:\r\nNone\r\n"

To accommodate these modifications, we need to make minor adjustments to Kubeproxy, particularly regarding certain HCN API calls for updating load balancers and deleting remote endpoints. Without these updates, certain functionalities, such as proxy terminating endpoints, would be broken on newer versions of Windows OS.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, this PR encompasses two main changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously, updating the load balancer policy involved deleting and recreating the load balancer. Now, we're leveraging a pre-existing update load balancer policy API, which was not previously implemented in our control plane, to simplify the update process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR aims to streamline the management of remote endpoint lifecycles. Previously, unready pods underwent unnecessary multiple deletion and recreation phases. With these adjustments, each IP will now undergo a single create and delete cycle for remote endpoints.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\nNONE\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

Thus:\r\n\r\n1. Require that kube-proxy be using `nft` 1.0.1 or later, to ensure that other people's use of nftables won't break kube-proxy.\r\n2. Require that the kernel is 5.13 or newer, to hopefully ensure that the system has `nft` 1.0.1 or later, to ensure that kube-proxy's use of nftables won't break other people. (We can't directly check the system nft version, but all known distros with kernel 5.13 or later also have nft 1.0.1 or later.)\r\n3. The `nftables.skipKernelVersionCheck` config option allows bypassing the above check for dev/testing purposes. (As of April 2024 there are still supported versions of LTS distros using slightly older kernels, though by the time we go GA this should no longer be true.)\r\n\r\nMore discussion in #122743.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nFixes #122743\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\nknftables rebase stolen from #123389...\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nThe (alpha) nftables mode of kube-proxy now requires version 1.0.1 or later\r\nof the nft command-line, and kernel 5.13 or later.

If an alpha field that is not defaulted graduates to adding a default in beta, an API server upgrade from alpha-\u003ebeta will modify this data.\r\n2. If an field is enabled through feature gate, if we disable the gate or enable the gate, the data will also be modified.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/12326#issuecomment-704469840, we know that pods will be drained when upgrading kubelet, so we can change this mechanism on a minor version boundary.\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #122028 #63814\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

This would make testing more expensive for Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n- To enable those tests only once in the ci-kubernetes-e2e-kind-alpha-features and ci-kubernetes-e2e-kind-beta-features definition instead of having to update those each time feature gates change.\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by adding `Feature:Alpha` resp. `Feature:Beta` as Ginkgo labels instead of just `Alpha` and `Beta`. Then jobs which are configured to skip tests with feature dependencies via `--label-filter=!/^Feature:.+/` will skip tests which are labeled with just WithFeatureGate. The ci-kubernetes jobs can select to include such tests with the new set-based Ginkgo label filter (see https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7824).\r\n\r\nNote that removing WithFeature depends on first updating job definitions to use --label-filter or to skip based on the inline `[Alpha]` or `[Beta]` text, otherwise tests that were previously skipped because of WithFeature might start to run in jobs which don't have the feature gate enabled.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\ne2e.test and e2e_node.test: tests which depend on alpha or beta feature gates now have `Feature:Alpha` or `Feature:Beta` as Ginkgo labels.

This change is ratcheted, so CREATE will still throw the error, but UPDATE will allow violations of this rule to persist.\r\n\r\nThis is used in declarative validation of native types, which will make extensive use of allOf to enable sharing of common types with custom case-specific validation at the point-of-use.\r\n\r\nFor CRD authors this enables the use of CEL expressions in `allOf` and `allOf.additionalProperties`. Most of the benefits to allOf are for shared schemas which are not supported today in CRDs.

Log rotation is done by renaming the file, but this action may fail if the file is already opened.\r\n\r\nSetting the ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` flag when opening the file will prevent this issue, as documented: ``\"Delete access allows both delete and rename operations\"`` [1].\r\n\r\nIn golang, there's no way to set this flag [2], the ``sharemode`` is always set to: ``sharemode := uint32(FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE)``\r\n\r\nThus, we need to open the file ourselves with the right flags.\r\n\r\n[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea?redirectedfrom=MSDN\r\n[2] https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.2:src/syscall/syscall_windows.go;l=366\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #124443\r\nRelated: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/51540\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

This feature is important for us when we start generating short shorter-lived certificates for kubelet\r\n\r\nCurrently in Kubelet:\r\n - The **client side** TLS has been handling the certificate reload very well thanks to the [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go). \r\n In our testing, the kubelet -\u003e API server requests never encountered issues. The pod can be deployed and started correctly on the host after the kubelet certificate file expired and then regenerated.\r\n - But the **server side** TLS doesn't have auto-reload. Therefore, the https requests to kubelet (such as access container kubectl log or kubectl exec) would fail with following error message if the certificate loaded in kubelet server TLSconfig expired. \r\n ```\r\nError from server: Get \"https://\u003c...hostname\u003e.com:20250/containerLogs/....: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2024-04-24T00:11:34Z is after 2024-04-12T00:52:35Z\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n1. The logic is expressed as  a `certificate.Manager` so that it could be used similarly to other struct in pkg/kubelet/certificate/kubelet.go.\r\n2. The internal file watch and read implementation is based on `DynamicCertKeyPairContent` struct in [ k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/dynamiccertificates](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/dynamiccertificates).\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nkubelet server can now dynamically load certificate files\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n"

For \"claim was deallocated\", this led to a small, unlikely race if a pod got scheduled and stopped so quickly that the informer cache didn't ever see the \"claim is allocated\" state. The event handler now reacts to changes in the assume cache because that cache is guaranteed to receive the \"claim is allocated\" state which cause some pod to not get scheduled, because by definition the cache must have listed some other claim as using resources needed for that pod.\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nFixes #https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/123698\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nDRA: fix some small, unlikely race condition during pod scheduling\r\n```\r\n\r\n/assign @kerthcet \r\n\r\nDo you have time to review?\r\n\r\n/cc @towca \r\n\r\nThis is related to the work that you are doing for the cluster autoscaler.\r\n"

Automatic checking found this during the execution of the \"with translated parameters on single node.*supports sharing a claim sequentially\" E2E test, but only when run stand-alone. When running in parallel (as in the CI), the bad outcome of the race did not occur.\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\nThe fix is to check that the finalizer is still set when adding the allocation. This can be done with a complicated JSON patch (see first commit, but only if you are really, really curious!), but a local retry loop with Update calls is simpler.\r\n\r\nThe resource claim controller doesn't need this, it can do a normal update which implicitly checks ResourceVersion.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nDRA: using structured parameters with a claim that gets reused between pods may have led to a claim with an invalid state (allocated without a finalizer) which then caused scheduling of pods using the claim to stop.\r\n```\r\n"

To keep this diff as small as possible for cherry-pick, we will defer the fix of those to a future minor version. This future change will require a breaking change to the NodeToStatusMap type, to allow better than O(n), or at least really fast O(n), representation of many nodes with the same status.\r\n\r\npair @mskrocki \r\n/assign @alculquicondor, @liggitt, @Huang-Wei\r\n/sig scheduling\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\n\u003c!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #\u003cissue number\u003e`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n--\u003e\r\nFixes #124709\r\n\r\n#### Special notes for your reviewer:\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nImproved scheduling performance when many nodes, and prefilter returns 1-2 nodes (e.g. daemonset)\r\n\r\nACTION REQUIRED: For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, note that the semantics of NodeToStatusMap are changing: A node with an absent value in the NodeToStatusMap should be interpreted as having an UnschedulableAndUnresolvable status\r\n```\r\n"

In contrary, the status update triggered by `syncTerminating` pods was just based on the container runtime `containerRuntime.GetPodStatus`.\r\n2. Why does the container runtime not populate the IP information for stopped pods? \r\nBecause of the explicit check for SANDBOX_READY [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/291378cd33cb89342fa876e201030172bb33d3b9/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L1460-L1462)\r\n3. Why does the `podStatus` cache contains the IP information when `syncTerminatedPod` is called. Because it gets updated inside [updateCache](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae1859c896d742de1ee60a349475f8e28b61995/pkg/kubelet/pleg/generic.go#L432). Note that, in that case we also fallback to `oldPodStatus.IP` for stopped containers, see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae1859c896d742de1ee60a349475f8e28b61995/pkg/kubelet/pleg/generic.go#L424-L426).  \r\n4. Are there more fields that need to be copied? \r\nIt seems not. When calling `containerRuntime.GetPodStatus` on a stopped pod all fields except for [podStatus](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae1859c896d742de1ee60a349475f8e28b61995/pkg/kubelet/container/runtime.go#L307C3-L323) except for `IP` and `Timestamp` are returned. The `Timestamp` field seems only be used when storing in cache, see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae1859c896d742de1ee60a349475f8e28b61995/pkg/kubelet/pleg/generic.go#L478-L482), and [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dae1859c896d742de1ee60a349475f8e28b61995/pkg/kubelet/container/cache.go#L102-L117) . However, we don't store this status in cache.\r\n5. Why copy the information at the `podStatus` (*kubecontainer.PodStatus) level, not at the `apiPodStatus` (v1.PodStatus) level?\r\nBoth would work, but adjusting the underlying structure is less code (single field vs two), and keeps them consistent as commented [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125404#discussion_r1634560821)\r\n6. Is a more generic approach possible, rather than fixing a specific field? \r\nPossibly, we could fallback the IPs inside `generateAPIPodStatus` or `convertStatusToAPIStatus`, which also have access to `oldPodStatus`, containing the IPs, but this would affect many more code paths. The proposed fix is minimal to only fix the new status update introduced in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115331/: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115331/files#diff-67dd9e8f3ee257072765326cb4f242852554a2c0753563fa51e292c0a63a7b94R2022\r\n7. Why after the fix there is one less status update? Because kubelet skips sending status update if there is no difference (skips sending patch if empty inside [PatchPodStatus](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a4b8edd0f7131f0979d1f7168de1bfa5cb838d01/pkg/kubelet/status/status_manager.go#L873)). The only difference between the 2 status updates triggered by `syncTerminatingPod` and `syncTerminatedPod` was the presence of the `IP` fields, so `syncTerminatedPod` is skipped.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

But, it didn't include E2E test. Moreover, I also realized cri-tools's my working PR(https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/pull/1438) is difficult to merge because critest's CI depends on [containerd's previous versions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/blob/master/.github/workflows/containerd.yml#L29).\r\n\r\nBecause the core logic for this KEP is implemented in container runtimes, E2E should detect whether the feature is supported or not at CRI level　so that we can implement _safe_ E2E which can gracefully skip it when the runtime does not support this feature. To do this, this PR added feature fields in RuntimeHandlerFeature both in CRI and kubernetes API.\r\n\r\nOnce the container runtime in E2E gets bumped and it supports this feature, the E2E for this KEP will be automatically activated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

Build JobSet using the updated `k8s.io/api`: \r\n- clone `https://github.com/kubernetes/api` into JobSet repo  under `bin/k8s_api/api`, and checkout the `release-1.29` branch\r\n- make code adjustments as in this repro (adding \"omitempty\")\r\n- adjust JobSet's `go.mod` with `replace k8s.io/api =\u003e ./bin/k8s_api/api` to use the code, and adjust its Dockerfile with new line `replace k8s.io/api =\u003e ./bin/k8s_api/api`, then `go mod tidy`\r\n- build JobSet image with `make kind-image-build`\r\n- load the image to kind: `kind load docker-image gcr.io/k8s-staging-jobset/jobset:0b8c19c-dirty --name kind`\r\n- adjust the JobSet image for the running deployment with `kubectl edit deploy/jobset-controller-manager -njobset-system`\r\n2. The JobSet creation succeeds, the `kubectl get job -oyaml` returns the correct snippet:\r\n```yaml\r\n    podFailurePolicy:\r\n      rules:\r\n      - action: FailJob\r\n        onPodConditions:\r\n        - status: \"True\"\r\n          type: DisruptionTarget\r\n      - action: Ignore\r\n        onExitCodes:\r\n          containerName: null\r\n          operator: In\r\n          values:\r\n          - 42\r\n```\r\n(same snippet is created when creating the Job directly, without JobSet)\r\n\r\nI have also confirmed that it only matters which version of k8s API is used to build the JobSet. In particular, when used fixed version to build JobSet, then I was able to create JobSets on 1.26 and 1.27 k8s clusters.\r\n\r\nI see we did similar fixes in the past like here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121000/\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n\u003c!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.
