  text: "kubeadm: enabled the v1beta4 API. For a complete changelog since v1beta3
    please see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/.
    \n\nThe API does include a few breaking changes:\n- The \"extraArgs\" component
    construct is now a list of \"name\"/\"value\" pairs instead of a string/string
    map. This has been done to support duplicate args where needed.\n- The \"JoinConfiguration.discovery.timeout\"
    field has been replaced by \"JoinConfiguration.timeouts.discovery\".\n- The \"ClusterConfiguration.timeoutForControlPlane\"
    field has been replaced by \"{Init|Join}Configuration.timeouts.controlPlaneComponentHealthCheck\".\nPlease
    use the command \"kubeadm config migrate\" to migrate your existing v1beta3 configuration
    to v1beta4.\n\nv1beta3 is now marked as deprecated but will continue to be supported
    until version 1.34 or later.\nThe storage configuration in the kube-system/kubeadm-config
    ConfigMap is now a v1beta4 ClusterConfiguration."
