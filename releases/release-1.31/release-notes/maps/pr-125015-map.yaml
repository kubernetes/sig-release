    The iptables mode of kube-proxy now tracks accepted packets that are destined for node-ports on localhost by introducing `kubeproxy_iptables_localhost_nodeports_accepted_packets_total` metric.
    This will help users to identify if they rely on iptables.localhostNodePorts feature and ulitmately help them to migrate from iptables to nftables.
