    The "fake" clients generated by `client-gen` now have the same semantics on
    error as the real clients; in particular, a failed Get(), Create(), etc, no longer
    returns `nil`. (It now returns a pointer to a zero-valued object, like the real
    clients do.) This will break some downstream unit tests that were testing
    `result == nil` rather than `err != nil`, and in some cases may expose bugs
    in the underlying code that were hidden by the incorrect unit tests.
