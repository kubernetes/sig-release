  text: "Added support to the scheduler to start using QueueingHint registered for Pod/Updated event
    to determine whether unschedulable Pods update make them schedulable, when the
    feature gate `SchedulerQueueingHints` is enabled.\nPreviously, when unschedulable
    Pods are updated, the scheduler always put Pods back to activeQ/backoffQ. But,
    actually not all updates to Pods make Pods schedulable, especially considering
    many scheduling constraints nowadays are immutable.\nNow, when unschedulable Pods
    are updated, the scheduling queue checks with QueueingHint(s) whether the update
    may make the pods schedulable, and requeues them to activeQ/backoffQ **only when**
    at least one QueueingHint(s) return Queue. \n\nAction required for custom scheduler
    plugin developers:\nPlugins **have to** implement a QueueingHint for Pod/Update
    event if the rejection from them could be resolved by updating unscheduled Pods
    themselves.\nExample: suppose you develop a custom plugin that denies Pods that
    have a `schedulable=false` label. \nGiven Pods with a `schedulable=false` label
    will be schedulable if the `schedulable=false` label is removed, this plugin would
    implement QueueingHint for Pod/Update event that returns Queue when such label
    changes are made in unscheduled Pods."
