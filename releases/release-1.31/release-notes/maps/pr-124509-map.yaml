    Introduces new functionality to the client-go's `List` method, allowing users to enable API streaming. To activate this feature, users can set the `client-go.WatchListClient` feature gate.

    It is important to note that the server must support streaming for this feature to function properly. If streaming is not supported by the server, client-go will revert to using the normal `LIST` method to obtain data.
