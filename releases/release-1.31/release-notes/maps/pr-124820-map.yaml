    'kubeadm: enhanced the "patches" functionality to be able to patch coredns
    deployment. The new patch target is called "corednsdeployment" (e.g. patch file
    "corednsdeployment+json.json"). This makes it possible to apply custom patches
    to coredns deployment during "init" and "upgrade".'
