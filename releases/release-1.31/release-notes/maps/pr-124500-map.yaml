  text: "kube-scheduler deprecated all non-csi volumelimit plugins and removed those
    from defaults plugins. \n- AzureDiskLimits\n- CinderLimits\n- EBSLimits\n- GCEPDLimits\n\nThe
    NodeVolumeLimits plugin can handle the same functionality as the above plugins
    since the above volume types are migrated to CSI.\nPlease remove those plugins
    and replace them with the NodeVolumeLimits plugin if you explicitly use those
    plugins in the scheduler config.\nThose plugins will be removed in the release
    1.32."
