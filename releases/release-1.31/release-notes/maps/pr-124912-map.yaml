  text: 'kube-apiserver: the `--encryption-provider-config` file is now loaded with
    strict deserialization, which fails if the config file contains duplicate or unknown
    fields. This protects against accidentally running with config files that are
    malformed, mis-indented, or have typos in field names, and getting unexpected
    behavior. When `--encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload` is used, new encryption
    config files that contain typos after the kube-apiserver is running are treated
    as invalid and the last valid config is used.'
