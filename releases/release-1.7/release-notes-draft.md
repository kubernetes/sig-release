## **Major Themes**

Kubernetes 1.7 is a milestone release that adds security, stateful application, and extensibility features motivated by widespread production use of Kubernetes.

Security enhancements in this release include encrypted secrets (alpha), network policy for pod-to-pod communication, the node authorizer to limit Kubelet access to API resources, and Kubelet client / server TLS certificate rotation (alpha).  

Major features for stateful applications include automated updates to StatefulSets, enhanced updates for DaemonSets, a burst mode for faster StatefulSets scaling, and (alpha) support for local storage.

Extensibility features include API aggregation (beta), CustomResourceDefinitions (beta) in favor of ThirdPartyResources, support for extensible admission controllers (alpha), pluggable cloud providers (alpha), and container runtime interface (CRI) enhancements.

## **Action Required Before Upgrading**

### Network

* NetworkPolicy has been promoted from extensions/v1beta1 to the new networking.k8s.io/v1 API group. The structure remains unchanged from the v1beta1 API. The net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy annotation on Namespaces (used to opt in to isolation) has been removed. Instead, isolation is now determined on a per-pod basis. A NetworkPolicy may target a pod for isolation by including the pod in its spec.podSelector. Targeted Pods accept the traffic specified in the respective NetworkPolicy (and nothing else). Pods not targeted by any NetworkPolicy accept all traffic by default. ([#39164](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39164), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))

	**Action Required:** When upgrading to Kubernetes 1.7 (and a [network plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/) that supports the new NetworkPolicy v1 semantics), you should consider the following.

	The v1beta1 API used an annotation on Namespaces to activate the DefaultDeny policy for an entire Namespace. To activate default deny in the v1 API, you can create a NetworkPolicy that matches all Pods but does not allow any traffic:

    ```yaml
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: default-deny
    spec:
      podSelector:
    ```

	This will ensure that Pods that aren't matched by any other NetworkPolicy will continue to be fully-isolated, as they were in v1beta1.

	In Namespaces that previously did not have the "DefaultDeny" annotation, you should delete any existing NetworkPolicy objects. These had no effect in the v1beta1 API, but with v1 semantics they might cause some traffic to be unintentionally blocked.


### Storage

* Alpha volume provisioning is removed and default storage class should be used instead. ([#44090](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44090), [@NickrenREN](https://github.com/NickrenREN))

* Portworx volume driver no longer has to run on the master. ([#45518](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45518), [@harsh-px](https://github.com/harsh-px))

* Default behavior in Cinder storageclass is changed. If availability is not specified, the zone is chosen by algorithm. It makes possible to spread stateful pods across many zones. ([#44798](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44798), [@zetaab](https://github.com/zetaab))

* PodSpecs containing parent directory references such as `..` (for example, `../bar`) in hostPath volume path or in volumeMount subpaths must be changed to the simple absolute path. Backsteps `..` are no longer allowed.([#47290](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47290), [@jhorwit2](https://github.com/jhorwit2)).


### API Machinery

* The Namespace API object no longer supports the deletecollection operation. ([#46407](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46407), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

* The following alpha API groups were unintentionally enabled by default in previous releases, and will no longer be enabled by default in v1.8: ([#47690](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47690), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))

    * rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1

    * settings.k8s.io/v1alpha1

    * If you wish to continue using them in v1.8, please enable them explicitly using the `--runtime-config` flag on the apiserver (for example, `--runtime-config="rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1,settings.k8s.io/v1alpha1"`)

* `cluster/update-storage-objects.sh` now supports updating StorageClasses in etcd to storage.k8s.io/v1. You must do this prior to upgrading to 1.8. ([#46116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46116), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))


### Controller Manager

* kube-controller-manager has dropped support for the `--insecure-experimental-approve-all-kubelet-csrs-for-group` flag. It is accepted in 1.7, but ignored. Instead, the csrapproving controller uses authorization checks to determine whether to approve certificate signing requests: ([#45619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45619), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))

    * Before upgrading, users must ensure their controller manager will enable the csrapproving controller, create an RBAC ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to approve CSRs for the same group, then upgrade. Example roles to enable the equivalent behavior can be found in the [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/) documentation.


### kubectl (CLI)
* `kubectl create role` and  `kubectl create clusterrole`  invocations must be updated to specify multiple resource names as repeated  `--resource-name` arguments instead of comma-separated arguments to a single `--resource-name` argument. E.g. `--resource-name=x,y` must become `--resource-name x --resource-name y` ([#44950](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44950), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))

* `kubectl create rolebinding` and `kubectl create clusterrolebinding` invocations must be updated to  specify multiple subjects as repeated  `--user`, `--group`, or `--serviceaccount` arguments instead of comma-separated arguments to a single `--user`, `--group`, or `--serviceaccount`.  E.g. `--user=x,y` must become `--user x --user y`  ([#43903](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43903), [@xilabao](https://github.com/xilabao))


### kubeadm

* kubeadm: Modifications to cluster-internal resources installed by kubeadm will be overwritten when upgrading from v1.6 to v1.7. ([#47081](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47081), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))

* kubeadm deb/rpm packages: cAdvisor doesn't listen on `0.0.0.0:4194` without authentication/authorization because of the possible information leakage. The cAdvisor API can still be accessed via `https://{node-ip}:10250/stats/`, though. ([kubernetes/release#356](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/356), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))


### Cloud Providers

* Azure: Container permissions for provisioned volumes have changed to private. If you have existing Azure volumes that were created by Kubernetes v1.6.0-v1.6.5, you should change the permissions on them manually. ([#47605](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47605), [@brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns))

* GKE/GCE: New and upgraded 1.7 GCE/GKE clusters no longer have an RBAC ClusterRoleBinding that grants the cluster-admin ClusterRole to the default service account in the kube-system Namespace. ([#46750](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46750), [@cjcullen](https://github.com/cjcullen)). If this permission is still desired, run the following command to explicitly grant it, either before or after upgrading to 1.7:
    ```
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding kube-system-default --serviceaccount=kube-system:default --clusterrole=cluster-admin
    ```

## **Known Issues**

Populated via [v1.7.x known issues / FAQ accumulator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/46733)

* The kube-apiserver discovery APIs (for example, `/apis`) return information about the API groups being served, and can change dynamically.
During server startup, prior to the server reporting healthy (via `/healthz`), not all API groups may be reported.
Wait for the server to report healthy (via `/healthz`) before depending on the information provided by the discovery APIs.
Additionally, since the information returned from the discovery APIs may change dynamically, a cache of the results should not be considered authoritative.
ETag support is planned in a future version to facilitate client caching.
([#47977](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47977), [#44957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44957))

* The DaemonSet controller will evict running Pods that do not tolerate the NoSchedule taint if the taint is added to a Node.  There is an open PR ([#48189](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/48189)) to resolve this issue, but as this issue also exists in 1.6, and as we do not wish to risk release stability by merging it directly prior to a release without sufficient testing, we have decided to defer merging the PR until the next point release for each minor version ([#48190](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48190)).

* Protobuf serialization does not distinguish between `[]` and `null`.
API fields previously capable of storing and returning either `[]` and `null` via JSON API requests (for example, the Endpoints `subsets` field)
can now store only `null` when created using the protobuf content-type or stored in etcd using protobuf serialization (the default in 1.6).
JSON API clients should tolerate `null` values for such fields, and treat `null` and `[]` as equivalent in meaning unless specifically documented otherwise for a particular field. ([#44593](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44593))

## **Deprecations**

### Cluster provisioning scripts
* cluster/ubuntu: Removed due to [deprecation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster#cluster-configuration) and lack of maintenance. ([#44344](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44344), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))

* cluster/aws: Removed due to [deprecation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38772) and lack of maintenance. ([#42196](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42196), [@zmerlynn](https://github.com/zmerlynn))


### Client libraries
* Swagger 1.2 spec (`/swaggerapi/*`) is deprecated. Please use OpenAPI instead.

### DaemonSet
* DaemonSet’s spec.templateGeneration has been deprecated.  ([#45924](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45924), [@janetkuo](https://github.com/janetkuo))

### kube-proxy
* In 1.7, the kube-proxy component has been converted to use a configuration file. The old flags still work in 1.7, but they are being deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Cluster administrators are advised to switch to using the configuration file, but no action is strictly necessary in 1.7. ([#34727](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34727), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))

### Namespace
* The Namespace API object no longer supports the deletecollection operation. ([#46407](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46407), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))


### Scheduling
* If you are using `AffinityInAnnotations=true` in `--feature-gates`, then the 1.7 release is your last opportunity to convert from specifying affinity/anti-affinity using the scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity annotation on Pods, to using the Affinity field of PodSpec. Support for the alpha version of node and pod affinity (which uses the scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity annotations on Pods) is going away **in Kubernetes 1.8** (not this release, but the next release). If you have not enabled AffinityInAnnotations=true in `--feature-gates`, then this change does not affect you.

		* Fix false positive "meaningful conflict" detection for strategic merge patch with integer values. ([#44788](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44788), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))

		* Restored the ability of kubectl running inside a pod to consume resource files specifying a different namespace than the one the pod is running in. ([#44862](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44862), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

    * Kubectl commands run inside a pod using a kubeconfig file now use the namespace specified in the kubeconfig file, instead of using the pod namespace. If no kubeconfig file is used, or the kubeconfig does not specify a namespace, the pod namespace is still used as a fallback. ([#44570](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44570), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

    * Fixed `kubectl cluster-info` dump to support multi-container pod. ([#44088](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44088), [@xingzhou](https://github.com/xingzhou))

    * Kubectl will print a warning when deleting the current context ([#42538](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42538), [@adohe](https://github.com/adohe))

		* Fixed the output of kubectl taint node command with minor improvements. ([#43171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43171), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))


### **Networking**
#### Network Policy
* [stable] [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) promoted to GA.
  * Additionally adds short name "netpol" for networkpolicies ([#42241](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42241), [@xiangpengzhao](https://github.com/xiangpengzhao))


#### Load Balancing
* [stable] Source IP Preservation - change Cloud load-balancer strategy to health-checks and respond to health check only on nodes that host pods for the service. See [Create an External Load Balancer - Preserving the client source IP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip).
  Two annotations have been promoted to API fields:

  * Service.Spec.ExternalTrafficPolicy was 'service.beta.kubernetes.io/external-traffic' annotation.

  * Service.Spec.HealthCheckNodePort was 'service.beta.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-nodeport' annotation.

### **Node Components**
#### Container Runtime Interface
* [alpha] CRI validation testing, which provides a test framework and a suite of tests to validate that the CRI server implementation meets all the requirements. This allows the CRI runtime developers to verify that their runtime conforms to CRI, without needing to set up Kubernetes components or run Kubernetes end-to-end tests. ([docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/cri-validation.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-tools/releases/tag/v0.1)) ([kubernetes/features#292](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/292))

* [alpha] Adds support of container metrics in CRI ([docs PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/742)) ([kubernetes/features#290](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/290))

* [alpha] Integration with [containerd] (https://github.com/containerd/containerd) , which supports basic pod lifecycle and image management. ([docs](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-containerd/blob/master/README.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-containerd/releases/tag/v0.1.0)) ([kubernetes/features#286](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/286))

* [GA] The Docker-CRI implementation is GA. The legacy, non-CRI Docker integration has been completely removed.

* [beta] [CRI-O](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o) v1.0.0-alpha.0. It has passed all e2e tests. ([release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.0))

* [beta] [Frakti](https://github.com/kubernetes/frakti) v1.0. It has passed all node conformance tests. ([release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/frakti/releases/tag/v1.0))



### **Scheduling**
#### Scheduler Extender
* [alpha] Support for delegating pod binding to a scheduler extender ([kubernetes/features#270](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/270))

### **Storage**
#### Local Storage
* [alpha] This feature adds capacity isolation support for local storage at node, container, and volume levels. See updated [Reserve Compute Resources for System Daemons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/) documentation.

* [alpha] Make locally attached (non-network attached) storage available as a persistent volume source. For more information, see [Storage Volumes - local](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local).

#### Volume Plugins
* [stable] Volume plugin for StorageOS provides highly-available cluster-wide persistent volumes from local or attached node storage. See [Persistent Volumes - StorageOS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#storageos) and [Storage Volumes - StorageOS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#storageos).

#### Metrics
* [stable] Add support for cloudprovider metrics for storage API calls. See [Controller manager metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/controller-metrics/) for more information.

### **Other notable changes**


#### Admission plugin
* OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement admission plugin ignores pods/status. ([#45747](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45747), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))


* Ignored mirror pods in PodPreset admission plugin. ([#45958](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45958), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

#### API Machinery
* The protobuf serialization of API objects has been updated to store maps in a predictable order to ensure that the representation of that object does not change when saved into etcd. This prevents the same object from being seen as being modified, even when no values have changed. ([#47701](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47701), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* API resource discovery now includes the singularName used to refer to the resource. ([#43312](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43312), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))

* Enhance the garbage collection admission plugin so that a user who doesn't have delete permission of the owning object cannot modify the blockOwnerDeletion field of existing ownerReferences, or add new ownerReferences with blockOwnerDeletion=true ([#43876](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43876), [@caesarxuchao](https://github.com/caesarxuchao))

* Exec and portforward actions over SPDY now properly handle redirects sent by the Kubelet ([#44451](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44451), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))

* The proxy subresource APIs for nodes, services, and pods now support the HTTP PATCH method. ([#44929](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44929), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

* The Categories []string field on discovered API resources represents the list of group aliases (e.g. "all") that each resource belongs to. ([#43338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43338), [@fabianofranz](https://github.com/fabianofranz))

* [alpha] The Kubernetes API supports retrieving tabular output for API resources via a new mime-type application/json;as=Table;v=v1alpha1;g=meta.k8s.io. The returned object (if the server supports it) will be of type meta.k8s.io/v1alpha1 with Table, and contain column and row information related to the resource. Each row will contain information about the resource - by default it will be the object metadata, but callers can add the ?includeObject=Object query parameter and receive the full object. In the future kubectl will use this to retrieve the results of `kubectl get`. ([#40848](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40848), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* The behavior of some watch calls to the server when filtering on fields was incorrect. If watching objects with a filter, when an update was made that no longer matched the filter a DELETE event was correctly sent. However, the object that was returned by that delete was not the (correct) version before the update, but instead, the newer version. That meant the new object was not matched by the filter. This was a regression from behavior between cached watches on the server side and uncached watches, and thus broke downstream API clients. ([#46223](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46223), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* OpenAPI spec is now available in protobuf binary and gzip format (with ETag support) ([#45836](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45836), [@mbohlool](https://github.com/mbohlool))

* Updating apiserver to return UID of the deleted resource. Clients can use this UID to verify that the resource was deleted or waiting for finalizers. ([#45600](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45600), [@nikhiljindal](https://github.com/nikhiljindal))

* Fix incorrect conflict errors applying strategic merge patches to resources. ([#43871](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43871), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

* Fix init container status reporting when active deadline is exceeded. ([#46305](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46305), [@sjenning](https://github.com/sjenning))

* Moved qos to api.helpers. ([#44906](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44906), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

* Fix issue with the resource quota controller causing add quota to be resynced at the wrong ([#45685](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45685), [@derekwaynecarr](https://github.com/derekwaynecarr))

* Added Group/Version/Kind and Action extension to OpenAPI Operations ([#44787](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44787), [@mbohlool](https://github.com/mbohlool))

* Make clear that meta.KindToResource is only a guess ([#45272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45272), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts))

* Add APIService conditions ([#43301](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43301), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k))

* Create and push a docker image for the cloud-controller-manager ([#45154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45154), [@luxas](https://github.com/luxas))

* Deprecated Binding objects in 1.7. ([#47041](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47041), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

* Adds the Categories []string field to API resources, which represents the list of group aliases (e.g. "all") that every resource belongs to. ([#43338](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43338), [@fabianofranz](https://github.com/fabianofranz))

* `--service-account-lookup` now defaults to true, requiring the Secret API object containing the token to exist in order for a service account token to be valid. This enables service account tokens to be revoked by deleting the Secret object containing the token. ([#44071](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44071), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

* API Registration is now in beta. ([#45247](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45247), [@mbohlool](https://github.com/mbohlool))

* The Kubernetes API server now exits if it encounters a networking failure (e.g. the networking interface hosting its address goes away) to allow a process manager (systemd/kubelet/etc) to react to the problem. Previously the server would log the failure and try again to bind to its configured address:port. ([#42272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42272), [@marun](https://github.com/marun))

* The Prometheus metrics for the kube-apiserver for tracking incoming API requests and latencies now return the subresource label for correctly attributing the type of API call. ([#46354](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46354), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* kube-apiserver now drops unneeded path information if an older version of Windows kubectl sends it. ([#44421](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44421), [@mml](https://github.com/mml))


#### Application autoscaling
* Make "upscale forbidden window" and "downscale forbidden window"  duration configurable in arguments of kube-controller-manager. ([#42101](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42101), [@Dmitry1987](https://github.com/Dmitry1987))

#### Application Deployment
* StatefulSetStatus now tracks replicas, readyReplicas, currentReplicas, and updatedReplicas. The semantics of replicas is now consistent with DaemonSet and ReplicaSet, and readyReplicas has the semantics that replicas did prior to 1.7 ([#46669](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46669), [@kow3ns](https://github.com/kow3ns)).

* ControllerRevision type has been added for StatefulSet and DaemonSet history. Clients should not depend on the stability of this type as it may change, as necessary, in future releases to support StatefulSet and DaemonSet update and rollback. We enable this type as we do with beta features, because StatefulSet update and DaemonSet update are enabled. ([#45867](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45867), [@kow3ns](https://github.com/kow3ns))

* PodDisruptionBudget now uses ControllerRef to decide which controller owns a given Pod, so it doesn't get confused by controllers with overlapping selectors. ([#45003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45003), [@krmayankk](https://github.com/krmayankk))

* Deployments are updated to use (1) a more stable hashing algorithm (fnv) than the previous one (adler) and (2) a hashing collision avoidance mechanism that will ensure new rollouts will not block on hashing collisions anymore. ([#44774](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44774), [@kargakis](https://github.com/kargakis))([kubernetes/features#287](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/287))

* Deployments and DaemonSets rollouts are considered complete when all of the desired replicas are updated and available. This change affects `kubectl rollout status` and Deployment condition. ([#44672](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44672), [@kargakis](https://github.com/kargakis))

* Job controller now respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting over Pods. ([#42176](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42176), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))

* CronJob controller now respects ControllerRef to avoid fighting with other controllers. ([#42177](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42177), [@enisoc](https://github.com/enisoc))

#### Cluster Autoscaling
* Cluster Autoscaler 0.6. More information available [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/README.md).

* cluster-autoscaler: Fix duplicate writing of logs. ([#45017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45017), [@MaciekPytel](https://github.com/MaciekPytel))


#### Cloud Provider Enhancement

* AWS:

  * New 'service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-extra-security-groups' Service annotation to specify extra Security Groups to be added to ELB created by AWS cloudprovider ([#45268](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45268), [@redbaron](https://github.com/redbaron))

  * Clean up blackhole routes when using kubenet ([#47572](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47572), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

  * Maintain a cache of all instances, to fix problem with > 200 nodes with ELBs ([#47410](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47410), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

  * Avoid spurious ELB listener recreation - ignore case when matching protocol ([#47391](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47391), [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb))

	* Azure plugin for client auth ([#43987](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43987), [@cosmincojocar](https://github.com/cosmincojocar))


* GCP:

  * Bump GLBC version to 0.9.5 - fixes [loss of manually modified GCLB health check settings](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47559) upon upgrade from pre-1.6.4 to either 1.6.4 or 1.6.5. ([#47567](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47567), [@nicksardo](https://github.com/nicksardo))

  * [beta] Support creation of GCP Internal Load Balancers from Service objects ([#46663](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46663), [@nicksardo](https://github.com/nicksardo))

  * GCE installs will now avoid IP masquerade for all RFC-1918 IP blocks, rather than just 10.0.0.0/8. This means that clusters can be created in 192.168.0.0./16 and 172.16.0.0/12 while preserving the container IPs (which would be lost before). ([#46473](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46473), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))

  * The Calico version included in kube-up for GCE has been updated to v2.2. ([#38169](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/38169), [@caseydavenport](https://github.com/caseydavenport))

	* Add metrics to all major gce operations {latency, errors} ([#44510](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44510), [@bowei](https://github.com/bowei))

	    * The new metrics are:

	    * cloudprovider_gce_api_request_duration_seconds{request, region, zone}

	    * cloudprovider_gce_api_request_errors{request, region, zone}

	    * request is the specific function that is used.

	    * region is the target region (Will be "<n/a>" if not applicable)

	    * zone is the target zone (Will be "<n/a>" if not applicable)

	    * Note: this fixes some issues with the previous implementation of metrics for disks:

	      * Time duration tracked was of the initial API call, not the entire operation.

	      * Metrics label tuple would have resulted in many independent histograms stored, one for each disk. (Did not aggregate well).

  * Fluentd now tolerates all NoExecute Taints when run in gcp configuration. ([#45715](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45715), [@gmarek](https://github.com/gmarek))

	* Taints support in gce/salt startup scripts. ([#47632](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47632), [@mwielgus](https://github.com/mwielgus))

	* GCE installs will now avoid IP masquerade for all RFC-1918 IP blocks, rather than just 10.0.0.0/8. This means that clusters can ([#46473](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46473), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) be created in 192.168.0.0./16 and 172.16.0.0/12 while preserving the container IPs (which would be lost before).

	* Support running Ubuntu image on GCE node ([#44744](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44744), [@yguo0905](https://github.com/yguo0905))

  * The gce metadata server can now be hidden behind a proxy, hiding the kubelet's token. ([#45565](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45565), [@Q-Lee](https://github.com/Q-Lee))

* OpenStack:

  * Remove the `--enable-cri` flag. CRI is now the default, and the only way to integrate with Kubelet for the container runtimes.([#45194](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45194), [@yujuhong](https://github.com/yujuhong))

  * CRI has been moved to package pkg/kubelet/apis/cri/v1alpha1/runtime as part of Kubelet API path cleanup. ([#47113](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47113), [@feiskyer](https://github.com/feiskyer))


#### Scheduling

* The fix makes scheduling go routine waiting for cache (e.g. Pod) to be synced. ([#45453](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45453), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

* Move hardPodAffinitySymmetricWeight to scheduler policy config ([#44159](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44159), [@wanghaoran1988](https://github.com/wanghaoran1988))

* Align Extender's validation with prioritizers. ([#45091](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45091), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

* Removed old scheduler constructor. ([#45472](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45472), [@k82cn](https://github.com/k82cn))

* Fixes the overflow for priorityconfig- valid range {1, 9223372036854775806}. ([#45122](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45122), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))

* Move hardPodAffinitySymmetricWeight to scheduler policy config ([#44159](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44159), [@wanghaoran1988](https://github.com/wanghaoran1988))


#### Security
* Features:

  * Permission to use a PodSecurityPolicy can now be granted within a single namespace by allowing the use verb on the podsecuritypolicies resource within the namespace. ([#42360](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/42360), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

  * Break the 'certificatesigningrequests' controller into a 'csrapprover' controller and 'csrsigner' controller. ([#45514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45514), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))

  * `kubectl auth can-i` now supports non-resource URLs ([#46432](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46432), [@CaoShuFeng](https://github.com/CaoShuFeng))

  * Promote kubelet tls bootstrap to beta. Add a non-experimental flag to use it and deprecate the old flag. ([#46799](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46799), [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese))

  * Add the alpha.image-policy.k8s.io/failed-open=true annotation when the image policy webhook encounters an error and fails open. ([#46264](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46264), [@Q-Lee](https://github.com/Q-Lee))

  * Add an AEAD encrypting transformer for storing secrets encrypted at rest ([#41939](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41939), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

  * Add secretbox and AES-CBC encryption modes to at rest encryption. AES-CBC is considered superior to AES-GCM because it is resistant to nonce-reuse attacks, and secretbox uses Poly1305 and XSalsa20. ([#46916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46916), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

* Bug fixes:

  * Make gcp auth provider not to override the Auth header if it's already exits ([#45575](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45575), [@wanghaoran1988](https://github.com/wanghaoran1988))

  * The oidc client plugin has reduce round trips and fix scopes requested ([#45317](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45317), [@ericchiang](https://github.com/ericchiang))

  * API requests using impersonation now include the system:authenticated group in the impersonated user automatically. ([#44076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44076), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

  * PodSecurityPolicy now recognizes pods that specify runAsNonRoot: false in their security context and does not overwrite the specified value ([#47073](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47073), [@Q-Lee](https://github.com/Q-Lee))

  * Tokens retrieved from Google Cloud with application default credentials will not be cached if the client fails authorization ([#46694](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46694), [@matt-tyler](https://github.com/matt-tyler))

  * Update kube-dns, metadata-proxy, and fluentd-gcp, event-exporter, prometheus-to-sd, and ip-masq-agent addons with new base images containing fixes for CVE-2016-4448, CVE-2016-9841, CVE-2016-9843, CVE-2017-1000366, CVE-2017-2616, and CVE-2017-9526. ([#47877](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47877), [@ixdy](https://github.com/ixdy))

  * Fixed an issue mounting the wrong secret into pods as a service account token. ([#44102](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/44102), [@ncdc](https://github.com/ncdc))

#### Scalability

* The HorizontalPodAutoscaler controller will now only send updates when it has new status information, reducing the number of writes caused by the controller. ([#47078](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47078), [@DirectXMan12](https://github.com/DirectXMan12))
