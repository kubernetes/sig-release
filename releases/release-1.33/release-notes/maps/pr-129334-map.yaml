  text: Improved how the API server responds to **list** requests where the response
    format negotiates to JSON. List responses in JSON are marshalled one element at
    the time, drastically reducing memory needed to serve large collections. Streaming
    list responses can be disabled via the `StreamingJSONListEncoding` feature gate.
