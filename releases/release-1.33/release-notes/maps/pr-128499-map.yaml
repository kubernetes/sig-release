    The `ClusterTrustBundle` API is moving to v1beta1.
    In order for the `ClusterTrustBundleProjection` feature to work on the kubelet side, the `ClusterTrustBundle` API must be available at v1beta1 version and the `ClusterTrustBundleProjection` feature gate must be enabled. If the API becomes later after kubelet started running, restart the kubelet to enable the feature.
