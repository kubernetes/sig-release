  text: "kubeadm: Promoted the feature gate `ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode` to Beta.
    By default, Kubeadm will use the local kube-apiserver endpoint for the kubelet
    when creating a cluster with `kubeadm init` or when joining control plane nodes
    with `kubeadm join`. Enabling the feature gate also affects the `kubeadm init
    phase kubeconfig kubelet` phase, where the flag `--control-plane-endpoint` no
    longer affects the generated kubeconfig `Server` field, but the flag `--apiserver-advertise-address`
    can now be used for the same purpose."
