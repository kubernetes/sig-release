  text: Addressed CVE-2024-51744, an issue related to unclear error handling in `ParseWithClaims`,
    which could lead to improper token validation. This was an indirect dependency
    from etcd and was not actively impacting Kubernetes, as the current error handling
    did not use `error.Is` in a way that would make it exploitable.
