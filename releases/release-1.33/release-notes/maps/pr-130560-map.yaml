  text: The `RemoteRequestHeaderUID` feature moves to beta and is now enabled by default.
    This makes the kube-apiserver propagate UIDs in the `X-Remote-Uid` header in requests
    to the aggregated API servers. The header is not honored by default for incoming
    requests, but that can be enabled by setting the `--requestheader-uid-headers`
    flag explicitly.
