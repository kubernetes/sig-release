  text: Kubernetes components that accepted X.509 client certificate
    authentication now read the user UID from a certificate subject
    name RDN with object ID `1.3.6.1.4.1.57683.2`. An RDN with this
    object ID had to contain a string value and appear no more than
    once in the certificate subject. Reading the user UID from this
    RDN could be disabled by setting the beta feature gate
    `AllowParsingUserUIDFromCertAuth` to `false`(until the feature
    gate graduated to GA).
