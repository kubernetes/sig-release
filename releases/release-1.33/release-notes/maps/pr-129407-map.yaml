  text: Improved how the API server responds to **list** requests where the response
    format negotiates to Protobuf. List responses in Protobuf are marshalled one element
    at the time, drastically reducing memory needed to serve large collections. Streaming
    list responses can be disabled via the `StreamingCollectionEncodingToProtobuf`
    feature gate.
