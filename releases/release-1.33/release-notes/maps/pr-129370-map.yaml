  text: CSI drivers that calls `IsLikelyNotMountPoint` should not assume false means
    that the path is a mount point. Each CSI driver needs to make sure correct usage
    of return value of `IsLikelyNotMountPoint` because if the file is an irregular file
    but not a mount point is acceptable.
