    When the `ImprovedTrafficDistribution` feature gate is enabled, a new
    `trafficDistribution` value `PreferSameNode` is available, which attempts to
    always route Service connections to an endpoint on the same node as
    the client. Additionally, `PreferSameZone` is introduced as an alias for
    `PreferClose`.
