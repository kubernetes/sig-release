  text: The EndpointSlice `hints` field has graduated to GA. The beta annotation `service.kubernetes.io/topology-mode`
    is now considered deprecated and will not graduate to GA. It remains operational
    for backward compatibility. Users are encouraged to use the `spec.trafficDistribution`
    field in the Service API for topology-aware routing configuration.
