## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Renamed `UpdatePodTolerations` action type to `UpdatePodToleration`.
  Action required for custom plugin developers to update their code to follow the rename. ([#129023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129023), [@zhifei92](https://github.com/zhifei92)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
 
## Changes by Kind

### API Change

- DRA API: The maximum number of pods that can use the same ResourceClaim is now 256 instead of 32. Downgrading a cluster where this relaxed limit is in use to Kubernetes 1.32.0 is not supported, as version 1.32.0 would refuse to update ResourceClaims with more than 32 entries in the `status.reservedFor` field. ([#129543](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129543), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Node and Testing]
- DRA: CEL expressions using attribute strings exceeded the cost limit because their cost estimation was incomplete. ([#129661](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129661), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG Node]
- DRA: when asking for "All" devices on a node, Kubernetes <= 1.32 proceeded to schedule pods onto nodes with no devices by not allocating any devices for those pods. Kubernetes 1.33 changes that to only picking nodes which have at least one device. Users who want the "proceed with scheduling also without devices" semantic can use the upcoming prioritized list feature with one sub-request for "all" devices and a second alternative with "count: 0". ([#129560](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129560), [@bart0sh](https://github.com/bart0sh)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
- Implemented a new status field, `.status.terminatingReplicas`, for Deployments and ReplicaSets to track terminating pods. The new field is present when the `DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy` feature gate is enabled. ([#128546](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128546), [@atiratree](https://github.com/atiratree)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Implemented validation for `NodeSelectorRequirement` values in Kubernetes when creating pods. ([#128212](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128212), [@AxeZhan](https://github.com/AxeZhan)) [SIG Apps and Scheduling]
- Kubernetes components that accepted X.509 client certificate authentication now read the user UID from a certificate subject name RDN with object ID `1.3.6.1.4.1.57683.2`. An RDN with this object ID had to contain a string value and appear no more than once in the certificate subject. Reading the user UID from this RDN could be disabled by setting the beta feature gate `AllowParsingUserUIDFromCertAuth` to `false`(until the feature gate graduated to GA). ([#127897](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127897), [@modulitos](https://github.com/modulitos)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Testing]
- Removed general available feature-gate `PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`. ([#129500](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129500), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Auth]
- TODO, as the current Rease Note is very big, we are keeping it for now to
  update it later (Before the final cut). ([#128971](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128971), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Auth, CLI, Etcd, Network, Release and Testing]
- `kubectl apply` now coerces `null` values for labels and annotations in manifests to empty string values, consistent with typed JSON metadata decoding, rather than dropping all labels and annotations ([#129257](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129257), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery]

### Feature

- Fixed a bug to ensure container-level swap metrics are collected. ([#129486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129486), [@iholder101](https://github.com/iholder101)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Graduated the `KubeletFineGrainedAuthz` feature gate to beta; the gate is now enabled by default. ([#129656](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129656), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG Auth, CLI, Node, Storage and Testing]
- Implemented full support for contextual logging in  `client-go/rest`. `BackoffManagerWithContext` was used instead of  `BackoffManager` to ensure that the caller could interrupt the sleep. ([#127709](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127709), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Auth, Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Network and Node]
- Improved scheduling performance of pods with required topology spreading. ([#129119](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129119), [@macsko](https://github.com/macsko)) [SIG Scheduling]
- Kube-apiserver: Promoted the  `ServiceAccountTokenNodeBinding` feature gate general availability. It is now locked to enabled. ([#129591](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129591), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Auth and Testing]
- Kubeadm: graduated the WaitForAllControlPlaneComponents feature gate to Beta. When checking the health status of a control plane component, make sure that the address and port defined as arguments in the respective component's static Pod manifest are used. ([#129620](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129620), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate is enabled, remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from a given node on `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129279](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129279), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: if the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate is enabled, remove the flag `--container-runtime-endpoint` from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129278](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129278), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: removed preflight check for nsenter on Linux nodes
  kubeadm: added preflight check for `losetup` on Linux nodes. It's required by kubelet for keeping a block device opened. ([#129450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129450), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: removed the feature gate EtcdLearnerMode which graduated to GA in 1.32. ([#129589](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129589), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubernetes is now built with go `1.23.4`. ([#129422](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129422), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Release and Testing]
- Promoted the feature gate `CSIMigrationPortworx` to GA. If your applications are using Portworx volumes, please make sure that the corresponding Portworx CSI driver is installed on your cluster **before** upgrading to 1.31 or later because all operations for the in-tree `portworxVolume` type are redirected to the pxd.portworx.com CSI driver when the feature gate is enabled. ([#129297](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129297), [@gohilankit](https://github.com/gohilankit)) [SIG Storage]
- The `SidecarContainers` feature has graduated to GA. 'SidecarContainers' feature gate was locked to default value and will be removed in v1.36. If you were setting this feature gate explicitly, please remove it now. ([#129731](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129731), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]
- Upgraded the `kubectl autoscale` subcommand to use `autoscaling/v2` rather than `autoscaling/v1` APIs. The command now attempts to use the `autoscaling/v2` API first. If the `autoscaling/v2` API is unavailable or an error occurs, it falls fall back to the `autoscaling/v1` API. ([#128950](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128950), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Autoscaling and CLI]

### Documentation

- Added an example of set-based requirements for the  `-l` / `--selector` command line option to `kubectl`. ([#129106](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129106), [@rotsix](https://github.com/rotsix))
- Kubeadm: improved the `kubeadm reset` message for manual cleanups and referenced https://k8s.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/. ([#129644](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129644), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

### Bug or Regression

- --feature-gate=InOrderInformers (default on), causes informers to process watch streams in order as opposed to grouping updates for the same item close together.  Binaries embedding client-go, but not wiring the featuregates can disable by setting the `KUBE_FEATURE_InOrderInformers=false`. ([#129568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129568), [@deads2k](https://github.com/deads2k)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Added a validation for the `revisionHistoryLimit` field in the `.spec` of a StatefulSet, to prevent it from being set to a negative value. ([#129017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129017), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Changed the signature of `PublishResources()` for ResourceSlices to accept a `resourceslice.DriverResources` parameter instead of a `Resources` parameter. ([#129142](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129142), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- DRA: the explanation for why a pod which wasn't using ResourceClaims was unscheduleable included a useless "no new claims to deallocate" when it was unscheduleable for some other reasons. ([#129823](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129823), [@googs1025](https://github.com/googs1025)) [SIG Node and Scheduling]
- Enabled ratcheting validation on `status` subresources for CustomResourceDefinitions. ([#129506](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129506), [@JoelSpeed](https://github.com/JoelSpeed))
- Fixed CVE-2024-51744. ([#128621](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128621), [@kmala](https://github.com/kmala)) [SIG Auth, Cloud Provider and Node]
- Fixed `kubectl wait --for=create` behavior with label selectors, to properly wait for resources with matching labels to appear. ([#128662](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128662), [@omerap12](https://github.com/omerap12)) [SIG CLI and Testing]
- Fixed a bug in HorizontalPodAutoscaler. HPAs with `ContainerResource` metrics no longer error when container metrics are missing. Instead they use the same logic as `Resource` metrics to perform calculations. ([#127193](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127193), [@DP19](https://github.com/DP19)) [SIG Apps and Autoscaling]
- Fixed a bug where adding an ephemeral container to a pod which references a new secret or config map doesn't give the pod access to that new secret or config map. (#114984, @cslink) ([#129670](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129670), [@cslink](https://github.com/cslink)) [SIG Auth]
- Fixed a bug where the kube-proxy `EndpointSliceCache` memory was leaked. ([#128929](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128929), [@orange30](https://github.com/orange30))
- Fixed a data race that could occur when a single Go type was serialized to CBOR concurrently for the first time within a program. ([#129170](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129170), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixed a panic in kube-controller-manager handling StatefulSet objects when `revisionHistoryLimit` is negative. ([#129301](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129301), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))
- Fixed a storage bug related to multipath. iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices attached to nodes via multipath now resolve correctly when partitioned. ([#128086](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128086), [@RomanBednar](https://github.com/RomanBednar))
- Fixed an issue with Kubernetes-style sidecar containers (in other words: init containers with an Always restart policy) and Services. Before the fix, named ports exposed by a sidecar could not be accessed using a Service. ([#128850](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128850), [@toVersus](https://github.com/toVersus)) [SIG Network and Testing]
- Fixed in-tree to CSI migration for Portworx volumes, in clusters where Portworx security feature is enabled (it's a Portworx feature, not Kubernetes feature). It required secret data from the secret mentioned in-tree SC, to be passed in CSI requests which was not happening before this fix. ([#129630](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129630), [@gohilankit](https://github.com/gohilankit)) [SIG Storage]
- Implemented logging and event recording for probe results with an `Unknown` status in the kubelet's prober module. This helped improve the diagnosis and monitoring of cases where container probes returned an `Unknown` result, enhancing the observability and reliability of health checks. ([#125901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125901), [@jralmaraz](https://github.com/jralmaraz))
- Improved reboot event reporting. The kubelet will only emit one reboot Event when a server-level reboot is detected, even if the kubelet cannot write its status to the associated Node (which triggers a retry). ([#129151](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129151), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips)) [SIG Node]
- Kube-apiserver: --service-account-max-token-expiration can now be used in combination with an external token signer --service-account-signing-endpoint, as long as the --service-account-max-token-expiration is not longer than the external token signer's max expiration. ([#129816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129816), [@sambdavidson](https://github.com/sambdavidson)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]
- Kubeadm: Avoided loading the file passed to `--kubeconfig` during `kubeadm init` phases more than once. ([#129006](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129006), [@kokes](https://github.com/kokes))
- Kubeadm: fixed a bug where an image is not pulled if there is an error with the sandbox image from CRI. ([#129594](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129594), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: fixed a bug where the `node.skipPhases` in UpgradeConfiguration is not respected by the `kubeadm upgrade node` subcommand. ([#129452](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129452), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: fixed the bug where the v1beta4 Timeouts.EtcdAPICall field was not respected in etcd client operations, and the default timeout of 2 minutes was always used. ([#129859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129859), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: if an addon is disabled in the ClusterConfiguration, skip it during upgrade. ([#129418](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129418), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: run kernel version and OS version preflight checks for `kubeadm upgrade`. ([#129401](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129401), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Provides an additional function argument to directly specify the version for the tools that the consumers wished to use. ([#129658](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129658), [@unmarshall](https://github.com/unmarshall))
- Removed the limitation on exposing port 10250 externally using a Service. ([#129174](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129174), [@RyanAoh](https://github.com/RyanAoh)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- [kubectl] Improved the describe output for projected volume sources to clearly indicate whether Secret and ConfigMap entries are optional. ([#129457](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129457), [@gshaibi](https://github.com/gshaibi)) [SIG CLI]
