  text: '`kubeadm`: a separate "super-admin.conf" file is now deployed. The User in
    `admin.conf` is now bound to a new RBAC Group `kubeadm:cluster-admins` that has
    `cluster-admin` `ClusterRole` access. The User in `super-admin.conf` is now bound
    to the `system:masters` built-in super-powers / break-glass Group that can bypass
    RBAC. Before this change, the default `admin.conf` was bound to `system:masters`
    Group, which was undesired. Executing `kubeadm init phase kubeconfig all` or just
    `kubeadm init` will now generate the new `super-admin.conf` file. The cluster
    admin can then decide to keep the file present on a node host or move it to a
    safe location. `kubadm certs renew` will renew the certificate in `super-admin.conf`
    to one year if the file exists; if it does not exist a "MISSING" note will be
    printed. `kubeadm upgrade apply` for this release will migrate this particular
    node to the two file setup. Subsequent kubeadm releases will continue to optionally
    renew the certificate in `super-admin.conf` if the file exists on disk and if
    renew on upgrade is not disabled. `kubeadm join --control-plane` will now generate
    only an `admin.conf` file that has the less privileged User.'
