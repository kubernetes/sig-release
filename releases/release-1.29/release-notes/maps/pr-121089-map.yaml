    The `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3` `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` APIs has been promoted to `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1`, with the following changes:
    - `PriorityLevelConfiguration`: the `.spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares` field defaults to `30` only if the field is omitted (v1beta3 also defaulted an explicit `0` value to `30`). Specifying an explicit `0` value is not allowed in the `v1` version in v1.29 to ensure compatibility with `v1.28` API servers. In `v1.30`, explicit `0` values will be allowed in this field in the `v1` API.
    The `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3` APIs are deprecated and will no longer be served in v1.32. All existing objects are available via the `v1` APIs. Transition clients and manifests to use the `v1` APIs before upgrading to `v1.32`.
