    Added new feature gate called `RuntimeClassInImageCriApi` to address `kubelet` changes needed for KEP 4216.
    Noteable changes:
    1. Populate new `RuntimeHandler` field in CRI's `ImageSpec` struct during image pulls from container runtimes.
    2. Pass `runtimeHandler` field in `RemoveImage()` call to container runtime in `kubelet`'s image garbage collection.
