  text: Setting the `status.loadBalancer` of a Service whose `spec.type` is not `LoadBalancer`
    was previously allowed, but any update to the `metadata` or `spec` would wipe
    that field. Setting this field is no longer permitted unless `spec.type` is  `LoadBalancer`.  In
    the very unlikely event that this has unexpected impact, you can enable the `AllowServiceLBStatusOnNonLB`
    feature gate, which will restore the previous behavior.  If you do need to set
    this, please file an issue with the Kubernetes project to help contributors understand
    why you need it.
