    `kube-proxy` now has a new nftables-based mode, available by running

        `kube-proxy --feature-gates NFTablesProxyMode=true --proxy-mode nftables`

    This is currently an alpha-level feature and while it probably will not
    eat your data, it may nibble at it a bit. (It passes e2e testing but has
    not yet seen real-world use.)

    At this point it should be functionally mostly identical to the iptables
    mode, except that it does not (and will not) support Service NodePorts on
    127.0.0.1. (Also note that there are currently no command-line arguments
    for the nftables-specific config; you will need to use a config file if
    you want to set the equivalent of any of the `--iptables-xxx` options.)

    As this code is still very new, it has not been heavily optimized yet;
    while it is expected to _eventually_ have better performance than the
    iptables backend, very little performance testing has been done so far.
