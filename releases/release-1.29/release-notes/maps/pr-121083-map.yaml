  text: Previous versions of Kubernetes on Google Cloud required that workloads (e.g.
    Deployments, DaemonSets, etc.) which used `PersistentDisk` volumes were using
    them in read-only mode.  This validation provided very little value at relatively
    host implementation cost, and will no longer be validated.  If this is a problem
    for a specific use-case, please set the `SkipReadOnlyValidationGCE` gate to false
    to re-enable the validation, and file a Kubernetes bug with details.
