  text: Mitigated http/2 DOS vulnerabilities for `CVE-2023-44487` and `CVE-2023-39325`
    for the API server when the client is unauthenticated. The mitigation may be disabled
    by setting the `UnauthenticatedHTTP2DOSMitigation` feature gate to `false` (it
    is enabled by default). An API server fronted by an L7 load balancer that already
    mitigates these http/2 attacks may choose to disable the kube-apiserver mitigation
    to avoid disrupting load balancer -> kube-apiserver connections if http/2 requests
    from multiple clients share the same backend connection. An API server on a private
    network may opt to disable the kube-apiserver mitigation to prevent performance
    regressions for unauthenticated clients. Authenticated requests rely on the fix
    in golang.org/x/net `v0.17.0` alone. https://issue.k8s.io/121197 tracks further
    mitigation of http/2 attacks by authenticated clients.
