  text: Fixed a situation when, sometimes, the scheduler incorrectly placed a pod
    in the `unschedulable` queue instead of the `backoff` queue. This happened when
    some plugin previously declared the pod as `unschedulable` and then in a later
    attempt encounters some other error. Scheduling of that pod then got delayed by
    up to five minutes, after which periodic flushing moved the pod back into the
    `active` queue.
