  text: Stopped accepting component configuration for `kube-proxy` and `kubelet` during
    `kubeadm upgrade plan --config`. This was a legacy behavior that was not well
    supported for upgrades and could be used only at the plan stage to determine if
    the configuration for these components stored in the cluster needs manual version
    migration. In the future, `kubeadm` will attempt alternative component config
    migration approaches.
