# Kubernetes 1.29: Mandala (The Universe) âœ¨ðŸŒŒ

![Kubernetes 1.29: Mandala (The Universe)](./logo/k8s129-mandala-512px.png)

This release is inspired by the beautiful art form that is Mandalaâ€”a symbol of the universe in its perfection.

In the spirit of Mandalaâ€™s transformative symbolism, Kubernetes 1.29 celebrates our projectâ€™s evolution. Like stars in the Kubernetes universe, each contributor, user, and supporter lights the way. Together, we create a universe of possibilitiesâ€”one release at a time.

The release logo, made by [Mario Jason Braganza](https://janusworx.com) (base Mandala art, courtesy - [Fibrel OjalÃ¡](https://pixabay.com/users/fibrel-3502541/)), symbolizes the little universe that is the Kubernetes project and all its people.
