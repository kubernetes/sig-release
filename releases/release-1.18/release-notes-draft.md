## What’s New (Major Themes)

### Kubernetes Topology Manager Moves to Beta - Align Up!

A beta feature of Kubernetes in release 1.18, the [Topology Manager feature](https://github.com/nolancon/website/blob/f4200307260ea3234540ef13ed80de325e1a7267/content/en/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager.md) enables NUMA alignment of CPU and devices (such as SR-IOV VFs) that will allow your workload to run in an environment optimized for low-latency. Prior to the introduction of the Topology Manager, the CPU and Device Manager would make resource allocation decisions independent of each other. This could result in undesirable allocations on multi-socket systems, causing degraded performance on latency critical applications.

### Serverside Apply - Beta 2

Server-side Apply was promoted to Beta in 1.16, but is now introducing a second Beta in 1.18. This new version will track and manage changes to fields of all new Kubernetes objects, allowing you to know what changed your resources and when.

### Extending Ingress with and replacing a deprecated annotation with IngressClass

In Kubernetes 1.18, there are two significant additions to Ingress: A new `pathType` field and a new `IngressClass` resource. The `pathType` field allows specifying how paths should be matched. In addition to the default `ImplementationSpecific` type, there are new `Exact` and `Prefix` path types. 

The `IngressClass` resource is used to describe a type of Ingress within a Kubernetes cluster. Ingresses can specify the class they are associated with by using a new `ingressClassName` field on Ingresses. This new resource and field replace the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation.

### SIG CLI introduces kubectl debug

SIG CLI was debating the need for a debug utility for quite some time already. With the development of [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/), it became more obvious how we can support developers with tooling built on top of `kubectl exec`. The addition of the `kubectl debug` [command](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/20190805-kubectl-debug.md) (it is alpha but your feedback is more than welcome), allows developers to easily debug their Pods inside the cluster. We think this addition is invaluable.  This command allows one to create a temporary container which runs next to the Pod one is trying to examine, but also attaches to the console for interactive troubleshooting.

### Introducing Windows CSI support alpha for Kubernetes

With the release of Kubernetes 1.18, an alpha version of CSI Proxy for Windows is getting released. CSI proxy enables non-privileged (pre-approved) containers to perform privileged storage operations on Windows. CSI drivers can now be supported in Windows by leveraging CSI proxy.
SIG Storage made a lot of progress in the 1.18 release.
In particular, the following storage features are moving to GA in Kubernetes 1.18:
- Raw Block Support: Allow volumes to be surfaced as block devices inside containers instead of just mounted filesystems.
- Volume Cloning: Duplicate a PersistentVolumeClaim and underlying storage volume using the Kubernetes API via CSI.
- CSIDriver Kubernetes API Object: Simplifies CSI driver discovery and allows CSI Drivers to customize Kubernetes behavior.

SIG Storage is also introducing the following new storage features as alpha in Kubernetes 1.18:
- Windows CSI Support: Enabling containerized CSI node plugins in Windows via new [CSIProxy](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy)
- Recursive Volume Ownership OnRootMismatch Option: Add a new “OnRootMismatch” policy that can help shorten the mount time for volumes that require ownership change and have many directories and files.

### Other notable announcements

SIG Network is moving IPv6 to Beta in Kubernetes 1.18, after incrementing significantly the test coverage with new CI jobs.

NodeLocal DNSCache is an add-on that runs a dnsCache pod as a daemonset to improve clusterDNS performance and reliability. The feature has been in Alpha since 1.13 release. The SIG Network is announcing the GA graduation of Node Local DNSCache [#1351](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1351)

## Known Issues

No Known Issues Reported

## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Action required

#### kube-apiserver:
- in an `--encryption-provider-config` config file, an explicit `cacheSize: 0` parameter previously silently defaulted to caching 1000 keys. In Kubernetes 1.18, this now returns a config validation error. To disable caching, you can specify a negative cacheSize value in Kubernetes 1.18+.
- consumers of the 'certificatesigningrequests/approval' API must now have permission to 'approve' CSRs for the specific signer requested by the CSR. More information on the new signerName field and the required authorization can be found at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests#authorization ([#88246](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88246), [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Node and Testing]
- The following features are unconditionally enabled and the corresponding `--feature-gates` flags have been removed: `PodPriority`, `TaintNodesByCondition`, `ResourceQuotaScopeSelectors` and `ScheduleDaemonSetPods` ([#86210](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86210), [@draveness](https://github.com/draveness)) [SIG Apps and Scheduling]

#### kubelet:
- `--enable-cadvisor-endpoints` is now disabled by default. If you need access to the cAdvisor v1 Json API please enable it explicitly in the kubelet command line. Please note that this flag was deprecated in 1.15 and will be removed in 1.19. ([#87440](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87440), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Instrumentation, Node and Testing]
- Promote CSIMigrationOpenStack to Beta (off by default since it requires installation of the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver. The in-tree AWS OpenStack Cinder driver "kubernetes.io/cinder" was deprecated in 1.16 and will be removed in 1.20. Users should enable CSIMigration + CSIMigrationOpenStack features and install the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-openstack) to avoid disruption to existing Pod and PVC objects at that time. Users should start using the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver directly for any new volumes. ([#85637](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85637), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Cloud Provider]

#### kubectl:
- `kubectl` and k8s.io/client-go no longer default to a server address of `http://localhost:8080`. If you own one of these legacy clusters, you are *strongly* encouraged to secure your server. If you cannot secure your server, you can set the `$KUBERNETES_MASTER` environment variable to `http://localhost:8080` to continue defaulting the server address. `kubectl` users can also set the server address using the `--server` flag, or in a kubeconfig file specified via `--kubeconfig` or `$KUBECONFIG`. ([#86173](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86173), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG API Machinery, CLI and Testing]
- `kubectl run` has removed the previously deprecated generators, along with flags unrelated to creating pods. `kubectl run` now only creates pods. See specific `kubectl create` subcommands to create objects other than pods. 
([#87077](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87077), [@soltysh](https://github.com/soltysh)) [SIG Architecture, CLI and Testing]
- The deprecated command `kubectl rolling-update` has been removed ([#88057](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88057), [@julianvmodesto](https://github.com/julianvmodesto)) [SIG Architecture, CLI and Testing]

#### client-go:
- Signatures on methods in generated clientsets, dynamic, metadata, and scale clients have been modified to accept `context.Context` as a first argument. Signatures of Create, Update, and Patch methods have been updated to accept CreateOptions, UpdateOptions and PatchOptions respectively. Signatures of Delete and DeleteCollection methods now accept DeleteOptions by value instead of by reference. Generated clientsets with the previous interface have been added in new "deprecated" packages to allow incremental migration to the new APIs. The deprecated packages will be removed in the 1.21 release. A tool is available at http://sigs.k8s.io/clientgofix to rewrite method invocations to the new signatures.

- The following deprecated metrics are removed, please convert to the corresponding metrics:
