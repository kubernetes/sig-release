# Release Team Removal Process
	
The release team is reassembled with a new team for each cycle. All team members are automatically removed if they do not re-apply and are selected for the next release cycle. While this process generally functions smoothly, there are instances when a team member might leave mid-cycle or the release team leaders may decide to part ways early. 

## Resignation
Voluntary resignation is outlined in the [shadow handbook](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/shadows.md#leaving-the-shadow-program-before-the-release-cycle-ended). The Role Lead should discuss with the Release Lead and the Emeritus Advisor (EA) to find a replacement if they would like to step down.


Remaining on the team without contributing creates an unhealthy environment for the rest of the team and negatively affects the outcome of the release. We strive to be inclusive and empathetic to individuals' circumstances, but our first priority is a stable, high-quality release.
The following outline is not meant to be definitive or punitive but rather outlines general guidance for leads on the process.  
## Shadow Removal Guideline

Reasons for removal could include but are not limited to:
- Failure to attend the shadow orientation hosted by the EA (we host 2-3 sessions at the beginning of the release cycle in different timezones)
- Failure to attend the orientation hosted by the Role Lead (if the Role Lead doesn't offer a timezone-appropriate meeting, the shadow should communicate to the Role Lead about obtaining the provided information async and watching the recording)
- Failure to attend 3 consecutive release team meetings without communication to the Role Lead
- Failure to perform shadow tasks in due time, after 2-3 discussions with the Role Lead and the EA about performance
- Unresponsive on Slack to messages for more than 2 days during non-peak time and 24 hours during peak time, without prior notice of absence. Peak time is different depending on the team's responsibility
- Violation of [CNCF Code of Conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/)

Note that communications ahead of time to inform the leads or find alternative arrangements are greatly preferred in these circumstances.
### Process
It is important to be kind and patient while trying to resolve the situation.
- Upon a pattern of inactivity, the Role Lead will notify the EA and have an initial discussion with the shadow about their performance.
- If the shadow is still not contributing to the team, the Release Team Subproject Leads or the Release Lead will remove the shadow from the team, and find a replacement if appropriate. The EA will be responsible for finding backfill.

### Consequences
- If the current release is the reason the shadow has Kubernetes membership, membership should be revoked
- Removal of name in release-team document
- Shadow will not be able to return to the following release. However, they are welcome to apply to releases after that

## Role Lead Removal Guideline
A role lead has been selected by the previous team lead to supervise, perform the duties of the team 
and mentor the shadows to be future leads. Failure to perform lead duties can have a lasting impact on the release team.
Reasons for removal could include but are not limited to:
- Failure to attend or send appropriate representation to 2 consecutive release meetings or relevant SIG meetings
- Failure to perform tasks expected of a Role Lead
- Unresponsive on Slack to messages for more than 2 days during non-peak time and 24 hours during peak time, without prior notice of absence. Peak time is different depending on team
- Violation of [CNCF Code of Conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/)

### Process
- SIGs outside of SIG Release, shadows, leads, or contributors can express concern to the Release Team Subproject Leads, Release Lead, or EA
- The Release Lead and the EA will have an initial discussion with the Role Lead
- If the situation is not improved, the Release Lead and EA will have another discussion with the Role Lead and begin to look for a replacement
- If deemed necessary by the Release Lead, EA and Release Team Subproject Leads, the Role Lead will be replaced with an experienced shadow or someone who previously led the same role. EA will be responsible for finding backfill
  
### Consequences
- Removal of name in release-team document
- Role lead will need to shadow again and demonstrate sufficient responsibility, and leading ability, before holding another leadership position on the release team

## Appeal
If the release team member disagrees with their removal decision. They can escalate to SIG Release chairs by sending an email to sig-release-leads@kubernetes.io.
