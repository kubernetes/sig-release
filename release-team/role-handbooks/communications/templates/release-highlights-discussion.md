This discussion is created by the Communications team to collect the Release Highlights for the current release cycle.

```
This is a discussion to collect the Release Highlights for the <version> release cycle.

Release Highlights are an essential part of the Kubernetes release cycle as they provide a birds-eye view of improvements, breaking or user-facing changes that are coming as part of the upcoming release. The release Comms team is asking for SIGs to comment on this discussion with items that we should highlight in release communications for <version>.
For each submission, please include a link to the KEP, the stage the feature is moving to, and a brief description of the KEP that will be used as an outline for the blog post content.

The deadline for <version> Release Highlights is <deadline>.

Here is the [discussion thread](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/2639) from the last release cycle.
