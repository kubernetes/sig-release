This message is sent to SIGs Slack channel to collect the Release Highlights for the release cycle.

```markdown
Hi SIG {{XXX}}! This is {{@YOURNAME}} from the {{v1.XX}} Release Communications team :wave:

Release Highlights are an essential part of the Kubernetes release cycle to provide a birds-eye view of improvements, breaking or user-facing changes as a part of the release.
On behalf of the Release Comms team, I would like to ask for your help gathering the Release Highlights for SIG {{XXX}} for the upcoming {{v1.XX}} release. If you have anything to call out, we would appreciate it if any of you can submit the content in [Kubernetes {{v1.XX}} Release Highlights GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/REPLACE_THIS_WITH_CORRECT_DISCUSSION).

We would appreciate if this can be completed by the deadline of {{DEADLINE DETAILS, in **BOLD**}}.

Thank you very much for your support in advance!
```
