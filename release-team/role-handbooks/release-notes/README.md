## Overview:

The Release Notes role is responsible for collecting and fine-tuning release-notes from the many contributions to Kubernetes between release cycles. This role is likely to find that work during the first several weeks of the release cycle is very laid back with the bulk of the tasks being completed at the end, once the release is firmed up.

The release lead will be responsible for introducing shadows to the team and the release notes subcommand in [krel](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/docs/krel) and may ask shadows to run it and make the update PRâ€™s. The release notes lead should indicate pain points and known issues to the shadows (if there are any) and work on strategies for overcoming them to avoid their coalescence during the later weeks.

If there are potential fixes to the issues indicated and team members are keen, fixes and automation of the process is very welcome but not expected.

## Prerequisites for Release Notes Lead and Shadows

### General Requirements

**Before continuing on to the Release Notes specific requirements listed below, please review and work through the tasks in the [Release Team Onboarding Guide](/release-team/release-team-onboarding.md).**

### Skills and Experience Requirements

- Strong written and verbal communications skills
- A working knowledge of Kubernetes concepts
- Project management experience is helpful but not required
- The release notes lead should take the [Inclusive Speaker Orientation (LFC101)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-speaker-orientation/) training course

### Time Requirements

Compared to other release team roles, release notes is one of the least time intensive roles.

#### Onboarding Session (week 1) ~1 hour

In the first week of the release cycle, the Release Notes Lead will organize an onboarding session with the shadows to go over general responsibilities and expectations.

#### Early and mid release cycle (weeks 1-8) ~1-5 hours/week

In the first 8 weeks of the cycle, the Release Notes team should/must, attend weekly release meetings and run the [release-notes subcommand of krel](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/release-notes.md) as well as update the [release-notes website](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes) for every `alpha`, `beta` and `rc` to create an early draft of the release notes. This ensures that the overall quality of the release notes can be verified from the beginning of the release cycle.

#### Late release cycle (weeks 9-12+) ~4-10 hours/week

This period has an increase in release team meetings each week and there is also significantly more work to do to ensure the release notes are in good working order for the release.

The Release Notes team should use the [template](relnotes-template.md) to organize the raw generated release notes in the Google doc as best as possible and help to guide SIG leads and members in their further editing of the release notes. The final edited release notes should follow this template. 

The `release-notes` subcommand of `krel` must continue to be run on the release branch (for `beta` and `rc` releases) in order to pull in any outstanding PRs that are merged between the beginning of code freeze and the release.

### GitHub Organization Membership

As well as becoming a member of the kubernetes GitHub organization as discussed in the [Release Team Onboarding Guide](/release-team/release-team-onboarding.md), release notes members should ensure that they [become members of the kubernetes-sigs GitHub organization](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#kubernetes-ecosystem). The tooling used by the release notes team creates pull requests kubernetes and kubernetes-sigs repositories, so membership of both is needed to streamline reviews.

### Machine and GitHub Setup

#### Setup krel

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your machine and follow the [instructions to build the release tools](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/docs/krel#installation) in your machine. Check the system requirements in the krel documentation.

#### Fork the kubernetes repositories

Fork the following repositories to your GitHub account, and clone them using SSH:

 - [`kubernetes/sig-release`](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release): This is where you will push regular PRs to keep the Release Notes draft up to date.
 - [`kubernetes-sigs/release-notes`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes): This repo has the [release notes website](https://relnotes.k8s.io) sources

## Tasks and Responsibilities

### Manage permissions

Release Notes lead should be responsible for granting team members required access:
1. Add OWNERS file into release notes directory. [Sample PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1691) for v1.23 release.
2. Add release notes team members for CHANGELOG review/approval.
   [Sample PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104759) for v1.23 release.

### Setup the Tools and Generate the Release Notes

The main task of the Release Notes team is the generation of the release notes during the release cycle.

At least one member of the Release Notes Team should be responsible for [setting up](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/docs/krel#installation) and [running](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/release-notes.md) the release-notes subcommand of krel to generate both versions of the release notes after each Patch Release:

1. Update the release notes draft, a markdown file which will become the final document which will encompass all release notes written by contributors during the current release cycle. See previous drafts for versions [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.24/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md), [v1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.23/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md) or [v1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.22/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md).

2. The team is responsible for adding Patch Release (e.g. [1.22.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#v12210), etc.) notes to the release notes website at <https://relnotes.k8s.io>. The krel release notes subcommand will automatically generate the necessary JSON files and patch the release notes website source.
Note that there are plans to improve the workflow [1087](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/1087)

Detailed instructions for generating the release notes bundles are in the [krel release-notes subcommand documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/release-notes.md).

### Periodically review and fix new release notes

The Release Notes team must make sure that the final document includes well written and informative release notes. To achieve a high-quality document the team should review and edit the
notes by running `krel release-notes --fix` weekly or as often as development pace
demands.

This command will enable the team to review each release note and edit the note's data.
It is recommended that the team splits the work among all members and runs the editing flow
on a weekly or biweekly basis. More information about the editing flow can be found in
a separate document detailing the [editing process and tooling](editing-flow.md).

### Attend Release Meetings and follow #sig-release

The Release Notes Lead and Shadows attend burn down meetings, SIG Release meetings and follow the [#sig-release](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C2C40FMNF) Slack channel for relevant information throughout the release cycle.

### Maintain the _Known Issues_ Issue

A ["Known Issues Umbrella Issue"](known-issues-bucket.md) for the release must be created by the release notes team in [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/new) so issues can be collected for the "Known Issues" section of the release notes. See previous known issues for [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/109027), [v1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104885), [v1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101728), [v1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98232), [v1.19](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90304), [v1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/86882) or [v1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83683).

### Ensure Major Themes are Reflected in the Notes

The Communications team will hold meetings to discuss blogposts and media releases regarding the release sometime before code freeze. Ensure that at least one person from the release notes team attends this meeting with the release lead and enhancements lead. The release notes team should ensure that the "Major Themes" identified in this meeting are reflected in the "Major Themes" section of the release notes. If no one is able to attend the meeting, reach out to the communications team, release lead or enhancements lead to ensure messaging around Major Themes is coordinated.

Besides a meeting with the Communications team a GitHub Discussion must be open to invite all SIGs members and volunteers to update Major Themes with topics that can be discussed in collaborative way. The discussion must be open in kubernetes/sig-release under General Category, past discussions: [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1868), [1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1709), [1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1575), [1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/1436).

In the case of still low reponse rate in the Github discussion each SIG can be ping via Slack as a reminder. To speed up the proccess an issue can be raised to allow multiple people to reach out to different groups, just like: [1615](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1615) and [1502](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1502)

### Get feedback from SIG Leads

Around Code Freeze, the release notes team will get in touch with the SIG Leads to capture the major themes of their SIGs. The team will also ensure that major issues captured in the release notes are confirmed by the SIG leads before release day.

If gentle nudging of SIG Leads is not effective in retrieving feedback/confirmation, the Release Notes Team can use a reasonable amount of creative liberty in completing the notes

### Clean up and edit the final document

The confirmed notes are cleaned up and copy edited by the release-notes team to ensure uniform language/style is used. The team must make sure that the final document conforms to the [Documentation Style Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/).

### Curate the External Dependencies Section

A "Dependencies" section should be curated which outlines how external dependency versions have changed since the last release. See [the v1.24 release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#dependencies-1) for an example.

Note that there are [plans in the process to formalize and automate the process of aggregating the changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2234), but this is currently [a very manual process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/398).

To update an entry in this section the following steps must be performed:

- Pick an entry, for example "Update default etcd server to 3.3.10 for kubernetes 1.14. ([#71615](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71615))"
- Open the linked PR 71615 and find which files and lines it modifies
- Open the same files in the `kubernetes/kubernetes` master branch and see if the version changed from v3.3.10
- Look at the history of the file and find which commit / PR changed the version
- Update the entry with the new version and PR URL
- Update the entry message accordingly - if the version has changed or it has been preserved between versions
- The website [lwkd.info](http://lwkd.info/) has weekly Kubernetes updates that often include information about changes in dependencies under a "Version Updates" section
- Kubernetes is released with the completed notes!

## Release Cycle Milestone Activities:
