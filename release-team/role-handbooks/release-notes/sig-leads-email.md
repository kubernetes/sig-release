Hey Sig-Leads,

<Brief intro>, I'm on the Release Notes Team for the <RELEASE NUMBER> release.
We've put together a draft of the release notes document so far, but we need
your help filling in the Major Themes section for your SIG. Please check out
the release notes draft document <LAZY LINK> ASAP and:


CTRL-F your SIG. For example, if you're the SIG lead of SIG CLI, then search
for "SIG CLI". This will show release notes that were contributed by your SIG
as well as release notes for features that were a collaboration between your
SIG and other SIGs.

Get a feel for what has been contributed by your SIG over the course of the
<RELEASE NUMBER> release cycle.

Find your SIGs sub-section in the "Major Themes" section of the document and
write 1-2 paragraphs of prose which outlines the high-level direction that your
SIG was moving in this release.


Additionally, if you know of anything that should appear in the "Known Issues"
section of the Release Notes, please leave a comment with the issue and a draft
of the note text on this GitHub Issue:
[<LINK TO GITHUB ISSUE>](known-issue-bucket.md)

If you have some more time and want to help shape your SIG's sections of the
release notes for <RELEASE NUMBER>, there are a few more things you can do as well!


In the sections for your SIG, feel free to copy-edit notes that may contain
what you know to be technical inaccuracies, grammar inconsistencies, etc.

In the sections where notes are attributed to multiple SIGs (including yours),
leave a comment if the note is more related to your SIG or one of the other
SIGs. We can then use this to further categorize the notes!


Please try to get your initial notes and themes into the draft by <DATE>. Thank you so much for helping put together release notes for your SIG, we know you're busy and appreciate your support of the <RELEASE NUMBER> release!
