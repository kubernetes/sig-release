Hey Everyone,

<Brief intro>, I'm on the Release Notes Team for the <RELEASE NUMBER> release.
We've put together a draft of the release notes document so far, but we need
your help to make sure that the work each SIG has contributed is reflected accurately.
Please check out the release notes draft document <LAZY LINK> ASAP and:

1. CTRL-F your SIG and edit/move notes to a more appropriate location--we just
ask that you do it as a suggestion so it's easy for the release notes team to
keep track of changes.

For example, if you're the SIG lead of SIG CLI, then search for "SIG CLI". This
will show release notes that were contributed by your SIG as well as release
notes for features that were a collaboration between your SIG and other SIGs.

2. If you know of anything that should appear in the "Known Issues" section of
the Release Notes, please leave a comment with the issue and a draft of the note
text on this GitHub Issue: [<LINK TO GITHUB ISSUE>](known-issue-bucket.md)


3. If you have some more time and want to help shape your SIG's sections of the
release notes for 1.15, there are a few more things you can do as well!
- Copy-edit notes from your SIG that may contain what you know to be technical
inaccuracies, grammar inconsistencies, etc.
- Remove minor and/or non-user facing release notes contributed by your SIG
- In the sections where notes are attributed to multiple SIGs (including yours),
leave a comment if the note is more related to your SIG or one of the other SIGs.
We can then use this to further categorize the notes!


Thank you so much for helping put together release notes for your SIG, we know
you're busy and appreciate your support of the <RELEASE NUMBER> release!
