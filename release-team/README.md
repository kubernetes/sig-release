## Overview

The Kubernetes Release Team is embedded within SIG Release and is responsible for the day to day work required to
successfully release while the SIG at large is focused on the continued improvement of the release process. Historically
the Release Manager (previously Release Czar)
and later Release Team has assumed the following responsibilities
- Authority to build and publish releases at the published release date under the auspices of the CNCF
- Authority to accept or reject cherrypick merge requests to the release branch
- Authority to accept or reject PRs to the kubernetes/kubernetes master branch during code slush period
- Changing the release timeline as needed if keeping it would materially impact the stability or quality of the release
these responsibilities will continue to be discharged by SIG release through the Release Team. This charter grants SIG 
Release the following additional responsibilities
- Authority to revert code changes which imperil the ability to produce a release by the communicated date or otherwise 
  negatively impact the quality of the release (e.g. insufficient testing, lack of documentation)
- Authority to guard code changes behind a feature flag which do not meet criteria for release
- Authority to close the submit queue to any changes which do not target the release as part of enforcing the code slush
  period
which shall be the discharged by the Release Team.

## Specific responsibilities

- Coordinate the resolution of release blocking issues

## Kubernetes Release Team roles

As documented in the [Kubernetes Versioning doc](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/release/versioning.md),
there are 3 types of Kubernetes releases:
- Major (x.0.0)
- Minor (x.x.0)
- Patch (x.x.x)

### Release Team Shadow
Any Release Team member may select one or more mentees to shadow the release process in order to help fulfill future
Release Team staffing requirements and continue to grow the Kubernetes community in general. Potential mentees should
be prepared to devote a significant amount of time to shadowing their mentor during the release cycle. Successful Release Team Shadows
should be prepared to assume a lead role in a subsequent release.

### Individual Contributors
Release responsibilities of individual contributors to the Kubernetes project are captured below

#### During a patch release
If you have a patch that needs to be ported back to a previous release (meaning it is a critical bug/security fix), once it is merged to the Kubernetes `master` branch:
- Follow the [cherry-pick instructions to open a cherry-pick PR.](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/cherry-picks.md)
- The Patch Release Manager will then review the PR and if it is ok for cherry-picking, will apply a `cherrypick-approved` label to it.

#### During a major/minor release

##### Propose and track enhancement
If you are developing an enhancement for Kubernetes, make sure that an issue is open in the [enhancements repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues). If you are targeting a particular release, make sure the issue is marked with the corresponding release milestone.

Ensure that all code for your enhancement is written, tested, reviewed, and merged before code freeze date for the target release.

During the code freeze period, fix any bugs discovered with your enhancement, and write enhancement documentation.

##### Write enhancement documentation

1. Make sure your enhancement for the upcoming release is on the release tracking board (e.g. [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nspIeRVNjAQHRslHQD1-6gPv99OcYZLMezrBe3Pfhhg/edit#gid=0) for 1.6).
2. Create a PR with documentation for your enhancement in the [documents repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io).
    - **Your PR should target the release branch (e.g. [release-1.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/release-1.6)), not the [`master`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master) branch.**
      - Any changes to the master branch become live on https://kubernetes.io/docs/ as soon as they are merged, and for releases we do not want documentation to go live until the release is cut.
3. Add link to your docs PR in the release tracking board, and notify the docs lead for the release (e.g. [Devin Donnelly](https://www.github.com/devin-donnelly) for 1.6).
4. The docs lead will review your PR and give you feedback.
5. Once approved, the docs lead will merge your PR into the release branch.
6. When the release is cut, the docs lead will push the docs release branch to master, making your docs live on https://kubernetes.io/docs/.

## Other activities of the Release Team

### During "Major" releases
To date no major release has been scheduled, however, SIG Release would be responsible for working closely with SIG PM
and SIG Testing to coordinate this effort across SIGs. The precise work required to produce a major release (e.g. 2.0, 3.0)
is undefined.

### During "Security" releases
For all unplanned or embargoed releases
- Facilitate security releases following the under the [Security Release Process](security-release-process-documentation/security-release-process.md)

## Release Team Selection

If you're interested in learning more about how the Release Team is selected, as well as how to volunteer, please review the [Release Team Selection Process][release-team-selection-process].

## Milestone Maintainers

Across release cycles, one of the best signals for [issue triage](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md#milestones) is whether or not an issue or PR is actually targeted for the current milestone.

To maintain up-to-date status on milestone inclusion, we rely on a set of Milestone Maintainers (members of the `kubernetes-milestone-maintainers` GitHub team) to apply the appropriate labels to issues / PRs. This is facilitated by `/milestone` commands and bot automation.

Each release cycle, the current Release Team Lead must update membership to the aforementioned GitHub team.

Maintainers of the `kubernetes-milestone-maintainers` GitHub team are defined as follows:
- SIG Release Chairs
- Current Release Team Lead

Members of the `kubernetes-milestone-maintainers` GitHub team can include:
- SIG leadership (SIG Chairs / Technical Leads) from all SIGs
- SIG milestone maintainers from all SIGs (in addition to SIG leadership)
- Special code reviewers, as selected by SIG Release

Maintainers of the GitHub team can, with justification, add or remove members at any time during release cycles.

Members are expected to actively triage issues and PRs to retain membership in `kubernetes-milestone maintainers`. Members not fulfilling the duties of this role should be removed.

Milestone maintainers also have write access to [kubernetes/enhancements][k/enhancements], which allows them to keep enhancement tracking issue descriptions up-to-date.

To request membership to `kubernetes-milestone-maintainers` or update the team:
- File a PR to [kubernetes/org][k/org] making changes to the `kubernetes-milestone-maintainers` team config [here](https://git.k8s.io/org/config/kubernetes/sig-release/teams.yaml). In your PR, include the reason you're requesting access in the description, as well as a comment next to your username in the team config
  e.g.,
  ```
  - justaugustus # Azure / PM / Release
  - spiffxp # 1.14 RT Lead / Testing
  ```
- Assign an approver from the group you'll be maintaining issues/PRs for
  i.e.,
  - for SIGs: Request approval from a SIG Chair or Technical Lead
  - for Release Team: Request approval from the current Release Team Lead or SIG Release Chairs
  - for Special code reviewers: Request approval from SIG Release Chairs

- Once your request is approved by the appropriate group, you can now assign to the PR to a SIG Release Chair for final approval.
