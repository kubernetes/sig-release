**Release Cut Alpha 1:**

### 3. Enhancements freeze up to Release Halfway Point (~Week 5 - 7)

**General Tasks:**
- [ ] Bring exceptions to the #sig-release Slack channel and to Release Team meetings, and make sure SIG representatives for the exception(s) know to attend and discuss if necessary.

- [ ] Identified with release-comms & sig-docs if a "Removals, Deprecations, and Major Changes" blog is needed and if so, started drafting it up (ref [1.26 blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/18/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-1-26/))
- [ ] Check with release-comms if they need help gathering "deprecations, removals and major changes" for the release. If so, assign KEPs to release lead shadows to collect this information from SIGs or identify highlight-worthy items themselves.

### 4. Release Halfway Point up to Code Freeze (~Week 8 - 11)

**Release Cut Alpha 3:**

**Release Highlights & Release Blog:**

### 5. Around Code Freeze (~Week 13)
Defer to the [code freeze section](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/release-team-lead#standards) in the release-team-lead handbook.

#### Shortly before Code freeze
Code Freeze begins, and it’s now the home stretch of the release. SIGs will need to ensure all work moving forward is carefully curated with required merge labels.

- [ ] Monitor the enhancements GitHub project to get an idea of how many PRs are still outstanding leading up to Code Freeze
- [ ] Monitor Testgrid and Prow to understand the stability of the release and PRs getting ready to merge. If Prow and Test grid are not in a good state consult folks from SIG Testing on delaying code freeze by a day if needed.
- [ ] Reminded the Branch Manager that branch CI jobs will be needed next week
- [ ] Send out a reminder email to [kubernetes-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev)

#### With Code Freeze
- As needed, assist the Release Signal Lead and Enhancements Lead removing PRs and enhancements from the milestone that aren't merged in time `/milestone clear`

#### After Code Freeze
- [ ] Verified that the [`release-1.XX` branch](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/branches) has been created by the Branch Manager
- [ ] Verified that the Branch Manager created the CI board on [Testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release) for the release cycle (1.XX-blocking & 1.XX-informing)
- [ ] Published the "Removals, Deprecations, and Major Changes blog"

### 6. Around Docs Freeze (~Week 12)

#### Shortly before Docs Freeze
- [ ] Monitor the docs tab of the enhancements GitHub project to get an idea of how many PRs are still outstanding leading up to Docs Freeze.
- [ ] Make sure everyone knows Docs Freeze is coming the following week. (week 12)

#### Week of Docs Freeze
- [ ] As needed, assist the Docs subteam lead with any last-minute escalations.

#### After Docs Freeze
- [ ] Bring exceptions to the **#sig-release** Slack channel, start a thread for each, and ensure SIG representatives for the exception(s) discuss in the thread.

### 7. Up to Release Day (~Week 14)
- [ ] Verified together with the release-docs team that all KEPs with required documentation are ready for review
- [ ] Completed release theme (slogan, logo and explanation text) and add it to the [release cycle documentation in k/sig-release/releases/release-1.XX](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases)
- [ ] Decided with the Release team if burndown meetings are necessary or updates are done via Slack thread on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- [ ] Discussed Release Lead succession with the release team subproject owner and sig-release leads
- [ ] Remind team lead to find successors for the upcoming cycle and discuss candidates with the subproject owner
- [ ] The task is now to ensure the release branch is ready to go. This means there are zero pending PRs, no failing 1.XX-blocking tests, no open issues in the milestone. This will continue until release day.
- [ ] Final documentation PRs are reviewed and ready to be merged. Likely, this is not true and some are outstanding, so you need to help convince SIG doc writers to get these in with urgency.
- [ ] Planned something for Release Day. Make the day as fun as you can for the team. Plan ahead for this and do something nice
- [ ] Prepared [Release Team gifts](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/release-team-lead#release-theme-gifts)
- [ ] The Communications Lead contacts CNCF to gauge media interest, schedule the CNCF Kubernetes release workshop, and publish the release blog post. Stay in the loop for that. If there is media interest in the release, an interview between the journalist will be organized by the CNCF.
- [ ] **Check in with the docs lead and verify tasks that should happen before the release day are completed (ref [release-docs handbook](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/role-handbooks/docs/Release-Timeline.md#release-week-week-12))**
- [ ] The Release Team Retro part 2 and part 3 is scheduled shortly after the "Release Halfway Point" and a host / facilitator is available
- [ ] Remind the release team to add items to the retro meeting agenda

### 8. Release Day (~Week 15)

- Note that release day can and should be postponed if any of the conditions outlined in week 11 are not satisfied.
- Every issue in the milestone is considered release blocking
- If you have to push the release date back, try to avoid Friday since it makes release publicity extremely difficult. Also, people seem to have patience with delay as long as the reasons are clear and openly communicated. This is your duty. You must over-communicate and ensure the team is also talking to their stakeholders (CNCF, community, press, etc.)

- The following final actions **must occur in order**, with successful completion of each being the entry criteria to the next.
  - Release day morning:
    - [ ] Go / No-Go: should generally be clear a day or three ahead of release, but the day's burndown provides a final opportunity for the team to affirm things are ready.
    - [ ] Docs Lead PRs final draft release notes to sig-release, with Release Team Lead approving merge.
    - [ ] Branch Manager does mock release build.
    - [ ] Branch Manager does mock publication. Validates with Release Team lead and broader team the mock announcement email content.
    - [ ] Branch Manager does nomock release build.
  - Starting when ready:
    - [ ] Communications Lead should have completed staging blog post, merging the blog with `draft:true` and creating a second PR that removes the draft with a `/hold` label.
    - [ ] Branch Manager Lead does nomock publication.
    - [ ] Branch Manager affirms build is complete.
    - [ ] Verify with the docs lead that the staging release website is in correct shape by verifying the blog posts, the release page, download page, etc.
    - [ ] Docs Lead publishes release docs to website (ref [tasks todo](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/role-handbooks/docs/Release-Timeline.md#release-week-week-12))
    - [ ] Branch Manager does release-notify.
  - [ ] Approximately 5pm Pacific: all work is complete and the release team
    lead announces release to [k-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev), [SIG Leads](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/leads), and discuss.k8s.io.
- [ ] After the release, it’s time to lift code freeze. The bot will need to be updated.
  - [Thaw k/k](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/de9e0a9821c4f73b83b4382df7a7dc837f91e18f/releases/release_phases.md#thaw), 
      master branch is then opened for new pull requests.
- [ ] The Docs lead thaws k/website
- [ ] Use all of the appropriate communications channels to announce the lifting of Code Freeze and thawing of 
  k/website, this can part of the release announcement.

### 9. After the Release Day (~Week 16, 17)
