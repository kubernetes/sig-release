### GitHub Username

e.g., (at)example_user

### [Release Manager](/release-managers.md) role

e.g., Patch Release Team, Branch Manager, Release Manager Associate

### Tenure

<!--
Provide reasoning behind the tenure selection here.
For temporary access, we should specify a revocation time AND keep the issue open until the temporary Release Manager has been offboarded.

Examples:
- temporary: Alice is a Release Manager Associate being granted temporary elevated access to execute the Branch Management role. Access should be revoked after the x.y.z-alpha.m release is cut.
- temporary: Carmen is a Release Team Lead being granted Release Manager Associate access to observe Release Management during the x.y release cycle. Access should be revoked once the x.y cycle is complete.
-->
e.g., permanent, temporary
